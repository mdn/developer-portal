The core team who evaluates requests is Sandra Persing and Havi Hoffman. Ali Spivak (Director, Developer Relations) participates in the call and makes the final decision to approve or not. Members of technical and engineering teams, such as Mixed Reality, Firefox Developer Tools, WASM, and others are both invited to the meetings and consulted before/after about suitability of specific events for their audiences/technologies, the appropriateness of requested topics, and for help identifying speakers (both within their organizations and volunteers/external people).</p>\", \"id\": \"e7599c78-39ff-47b4-8916-e42fe092859f\"}, {\"type\": \"paragraph\", \"value\": \"<h2>How will my request be reviewed?</h2><p>We have established this set of criteria by which we evaluate all event support requests:</p><ul><li><b>Alignment to Mozilla goals and strategy</b>: Your request shows a clear relationship between the event and achieving Mozilla, Emerging Technologies team, and our <a href=\\\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/\\\">DevRel|Developer Relations</a> goals. We have a set amount of funding every year, and we need to make sure that our dollars are spent on events that are supporting the goals we have set for the year.</li><li><b>Brand Alignment</b>: We will carefully evaluate the impact of having the Mozilla name and logo associated with the event submitted, and the people organizing/speaking/attending to make sure the request and our support is in alignment.</li><li><b>Diversity &amp; Inclusion</b>: Does the event demonstrate best practices in regards to speaker and attendee diversity?</li><li><b>Submission at least 8 weeks prior to event date</b>: It takes time to review the requests. Please be considerate and respectful regarding this time frame to allow sufficient time for consideration.</li><li><b>Mozilla participation</b>: Money alone doesn&#x27;t represent Mozilla very well, so we consider first to sponsor events where members of the Mozilla community (volunteers or staff) are participating. They could be attending, speaking, organizing, or participating in some other way, as long as they are at the event in person. <i>Note: If you have no Mozillians involved in your event, we are happy to help find someone to speak, attend, sit on a panel, etc., but this does NOT guarantee a sponsorship. Finding Mozilla participants is judged independently of sponsorship opportunities.</i> We also look at historical involvement and feedback: Did the event meet or surpass expectations and best of class guidelines? Do we know and trust the organizers? Have there been problems with/at the event in the past? If there were, how did organizers deal with them? These will help guide a decision and influence the amount we choose to invest.</li><li><b>No pay-to-speak</b>: We don&#x27;t pay for sponsored speaking slots, or accept speaking slots that are contingent on sponsorship. We prefer that Mozilla speakers be invited or accepted on the quality of their presentations and the interest the attendees have in what they have to say, not because Mozilla has paid to put someone in front of an audience. We believe this policy:<ul><li>is equitable to conference organizers seeking Mozilla speakers</li><li>is fair to other speakers who don&#x27;t have the means to pay for a speaking opportunity</li><li>helps us gauge interest in the topics and products we might propose to speak about</li><li>maintains the credibility of Mozilla speakers with audiences</li></ul></li><li><b>Budget consideration</b>: This sponsorship request process is specifically from the Dev Rel team. We are limited in resources and usually do not consider supporting requests that require significant sponsorship (in general, above $5,000 USD). However, we are happy to review the event and its purpose to help direct the request to another Mozilla division.</li><li><b>Code of conduct</b>: In keeping with Mozilla&#x27;s <a href=\\\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/\\\">culture of inclusiveness</a>, we require event organizers seeking sponsorship or speaker to create, publish, and enforce a code of conduct for their event participants. You can find examples and guidance for writing a code of conduct on the <a href=\\\"http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment\\\">Geek feminism wiki</a>.

Generally this means using WebGL. Since WebGL is very low level most developers use a 3D engine or library like ThreeJS, Babylon or others. Your favorite 3D engine may support WebXR already.</li></ul><p></p><ul><li><b>How do I get viewers for my WebXR site?</b> Let us know about it so we can feature it on the Firefox Reality homepage.</li></ul>\", \"id\": \"b69b2b32-d140-4c81-a028-2ac66b25dd9a\"}]",

		"transcript": "<p>Thank you, all, very much for still being here. It has been a long day. Your time is precious and I appreciate it. I appreciate you&#x27;ve stuck with it for the day. Also, thank you to someone who isn&#x27;t in the room, Amanda, thank you very, very much for the live captioning that you&#x27;ve been doing. Thank you to Mozilla and White Coat Captioning for doing that.</p><p>A bit of housekeeping, just I&#x27;m contractually obligated by the Public Speakers Guild, as the last speaker of the day, to say I&#x27;m the only thing standing between you and going for a beer. I feel like, in this situation, because it&#x27;s been two days of intense talks, I want to point out that you are the only thing standing between me and going for a beer.</p><p>So, I would like to talk to you, which is kind of weird, when you think about it. On two levels, I&#x27;m here to talk to you, like some clerical error on the part of Mozilla that&#x27;s ended up with me here. I&#x27;m going to talk to you. I&#x27;m literally going to stand here on the stage, move my jawbone and pass air through my throat for, like, half an hour or so, right? And you&#x27;re just going to sit there and take it. It&#x27;s kind of a weird activity, what we&#x27;re doing here, me talking.</p><p>But of course, the reason why it works is because I will be using language as I do it and hopefully we&#x27;ve all got the same codebase, English in this case. Language is amazing. I mean, language is one of the things that kind of makes us human. It was one of the great leap forwards in human civilization. Through language and moving my jaw and waggling this fleshy piece of meat, I can tell you something that happened and you are able to revisit the past. Or, I can imagine something in the future and relay that to you and you are able to travel to the future through language. So, language is a kind of time travel.</p><p>On a more basic level, it&#x27;s a form of communication, which is also amazing. I can have an idea inside my brain and I move my jaw up and down, vibrate the air between us and transfer that idea from my brain into your brain. So then, language is like a virus. Right. It&#x27;s almost involuntary. I can say, don&#x27;t think of an elephant. You thought of an elephant, right? That&#x27;s the auditory equivalent of the chicken game. You&#x27;ve played the chicken game and lost. That phrase &quot;don&#x27;t think of an elephant,&quot; that&#x27;s from a book. He has written books on language and he wrote this one back in 1980, The Metaphors We Live By. This conceptual metaphor, which is what we&#x27;re used to. You talk about one thing in terms of another thing and it&#x27;s really useful when you&#x27;re talking about something intangible. Time is a classic example. We can talk about time like it&#x27;s a physical object. Time moving through space, time flies, time drags. Saving time, wasting time. Time is intangible, but talking about time with a metaphor like that helps us conceptualize it.</p><p>But what George was interested in was cognitive metaphors. Political language, in particular, the framing we use in language could maybe affect the way we approach thinking about things. He says, if you&#x27;re going to have a debate about tax relief, you&#x27;ve framed taxation as something you need relief from. I think we are guilty of this, too. We talk all the time about what you can do now in the browser. The browser. Singular. Not browsers. Maybe this frames our thinking. So, I&#x27;m fascinated with the language and the metaphor we use to talk about the web and ourselves, the language and the metaphors to talk about ourselves.</p><p>The web&#x27;s a relatively new medium. We tend to borrow from the medium that came before. This isn&#x27;t new. This is something that Scott McCloud talked about. He is talking about how every medium borrows from the one before. He points out that many early movies were like film stage plays and television was taking radio and adding pictures it.</p><p>Now, this resonated with me because it reminded me of something I&#x27;d seen written somewhere else, it was something published in A List Apart. Who has read it? Good. Good. He makes the exact same point in this article, every medium borrows from the time before. Terrific article. By the way, I highly recommend you read it, even though it&#x27;s 19 years old. It is more relevant now. John says this, when a new medium borrows from an existing one, some of what it borrows make sense, but much of the borrowing is thoughtless ritual. And over time, the new medium develops its own conventions, throwing off the existing conventions that don&#x27;t make sense. So on the web, the medium that come before, if you were a designer, was print. It&#x27;s not the web. Designers kind of wanted to recapture that control they were used to in print, on the web.</p><p>That&#x27;s where we got Creating Killer Websites. This was 1996. Does anyone remember this? Awe, my fellow gray haired friends. This was the guy who came up with Tables for Layout and all the stuff Tejas was talking about earlier. This is kind of what John was pushing back on that maybe control shouldn&#x27;t be what we&#x27;re after on the web. Here&#x27;s what John said: The web is a new medium, although it has emerged from the print medium. Yet, it is too often shaped by that from which it sprint. Killer Websites are those which tame the wildness of the web, constraining pages as if they were made of paper. Desktop publishing for the web. But he does acknowledge that, yes, we have a lot to learn from this history of not just print, but pre print, layout, illuminated manuscripts. This is the next leap forward, after language, is writing. Now we can communicate ideas and you don&#x27;t even need to be in the same physical space, we don&#x27;t have to vibrate the air between us anymore. I can make marks on wood and I can put an idea into your head. Kind of amazing.</p><p>So, with this kind of debate, I guess, between John talking about the flow and the flexibility of the web, the wildness and then David talking about constraining things into control on the other, they seem to be two very opposing viewpoints, and they are. But they also have an agreement. Because what they&#x27;re agreeing on is the language they&#x27;re using as they talk about the web because both of them are talking about making websites. That, in itself, is a metaphor. I know it&#x27;s very unfashionable these days. We&#x27;re making web app experiences. Websites, how very dare you. We&#x27;re making websites.</p><p>That idea of a site is something you go to, a building site, a construction site. I mean, that was literally how we thought of it in the early days, right? Our pages were under construction\u00a0 I&#x27;ll give you the full, nostalgic affect. We used to say, oh, this is under construction. Let&#x27;s face it, it&#x27;s always under construction, we just stopped putting these animated GIF s on these websites. Here&#x27;s one that I hear a lot, we&#x27;re talking about what we do and how we borrow from another medium. We talk about our work, though we are architects. Right?</p><p>Everyone wants to be an architect. You talk to architects about the industry, it&#x27;s terrible. It&#x27;s a dumpster fire. It&#x27;s all about competitions and prizes and unbelievable spec work. You&#x27;re like, no. But still, everyone wants to be like an architect. I blame Hollywood. It&#x27;s become shorthand, you want likable person, oh, they&#x27;re an architect. The villain is never an architect in the movie. And there is a lot we can learn from architecture. I know many UX designers who consider this book to be the best work they&#x27;ve read. It&#x27;s 101 Things I Learned in Architecture School. A lot of the ideas and messages are absolutely transferrable to other mediums. There&#x27;s another book on software, Pattern Language by Christopher Alexander. This is a classic book. By &quot;classic book,&quot; I mean a book everyone&#x27;s heard of and nobody&#x27;s read. 1977. And it influenced people, Ward, who invented the Wiki, the gang of 4, the design patterns, directly influenced by Christopher because he&#x27;s talking about breaking things down into modular, reusable components. This absolutely resonates.</p><p>What&#x27;s funny, actually, is there was a book by Molly where she specifically looks at the influence of product designers, architects and she points out that Christopher had a huge influence in the digital world and almost no architecture. Architects don&#x27;t like him, they think he&#x27;s preachy. I ran an event all about components and patterns and design systems. I did it for a couple years. It was great. We got Jina Anne. By the end of the day, I was saying, we really should have had a drinking game, if someone mentioned a pattern language by Christopher, you take a drink.</p><p>Here&#x27;s the full drinking game I came up with, any time someone says Christopher Alexander, take a drink. Any time someone says Lego, take a drink. Any time someone points out naming is hard, take a drink. Any time anyone says &quot;bootstrap,&quot; puke it back up.</p><p>There&#x27;s another book, How Buildings Learn, classic book, 1994. In this book, Stewart looks at the work of Frank Duffy. He had this idea of buildings not being structured in space, but layers of structure in time and talked about sheering layers. A building properly conceived is several layers of longevity. So, he mapped out these layers, these sheering layers. You think about the site that a building sits on, you&#x27;re talking about geological time scale and the structure you hope will last for centuries, the walls, the plumbing, it gets shorter when you talk about the furniture you can change on a daily basis. This is sheering layers.</p><p>So, he&#x27;s interested in the time scales here. I spotted something else about sheering layers, each layer depends on the layer before. You can&#x27;t have the structure until you have the site. You can&#x27;t move stuff around in the room until you&#x27;ve made the walls and the doors. This idea of each layer in the sheering layers, depending on the layer before, it reminded me about the work of Steven Johnson. He keeps going back to this idea of the adjacent possible. Certain things need to exist before you can create something. It&#x27;s why you don&#x27;t get the microwave oven invented in Europe. The world wide web, you have to have computers, internet. You can keep going further. You build Facebook, Google, they depends on the web, which depends on the internet, which depends on computers. These layers of stuff that&#x27;s built up.</p><p>They depends on the layers below, the adjacent possible and sheering layers. Stewart Brand revisits this in a later book, The Clock of the Long Now. Anybody heard of the Long Now Foundation? Any members? All right. For once, there&#x27;s a member. Great! Dedicated to long term thinking. Longnow.org. All their years begin with five digits. And they&#x27;re building a clock that will tell time for 10,000 years, which is fascinating. I recommend looking at the design principles. So, in this book, time and responsibility, the ideas behind the world&#x27;s slowest computer, Stewart abstracts from architecture and applies it to everything. That sheering layers are everywhere and he calls this &quot;pace layers.&quot; This idea of different layers of time scales. He gives an example by taking us, the human race, and looking at the pace layers of the human race. The sort of slow, bottom end, the DNA, that doesn&#x27;t change. Culture builds up over centuries, with language, with countries and all this kind of stuff.</p><p>Governance, they tend to stick around for quite awhile, but they can change. Infrastructure needs to move faster than that. Commerce, very fast moving and fashion moves really quickly. So, he maps these pace layers on to this diagram. Right. Where you got the fast moving stuff at the top and the slow moving stuff at the bottom. He&#x27;s talking about pop music, where everything is supposed to change quickly. And it&#x27;s good that it moves fast. It would be dull if fashion moved slowly. You want it to.</p><p>Interestingly, the good stuff, the fast layers will make its way down into the lower layers. Like, a really good pop song, may become part of culture. So the way that Stewart says is fast learns, slow remembers. Fast proposes, slow disposes. Fast is discontinuous, slow is continuous. Fast and small instruct slow and big by a crude innovation, by occasional revolution. Slow and big control small and fast by constraint and constancy. He says fast gets our attention, but slow has all the power. This idea of pace layers, I&#x27;m hopefully going to be transferring from my brain into yours. I see pace layers. Like when a typography points out bad stuff to you. Thanks, you&#x27;ve ruined my life to you. That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s like for pace layers for me. It&#x27;s a joke at work. Time to pace layers, how long before somebody points out this is like pace layers.</p><p>Remember the first time someone points out the arrow in the FedEx logo? You&#x27;ve seen the arrow? What about this logo? Who sees the bear? You see the bear? Okay. You won&#x27;t be able to unsee that. Right. That&#x27;s the virus I put in your head.</p><p>Or, consider the duck. A perfectly normal duck until you&#x27;re on the internet and someone points out all ducks are actually wearing dog masks. All ducks are actually wearing dog masks. And now, when I show you the same picture of the same duck</p><p>You cannot unsee that. And that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s like with pace layers for me. It&#x27;s like, I see them everywhere. So I thought, can I apply pace layers to the web, to where we work? And I&#x27;ve given it a stab and I think it kind of works. So at the bottom layer, the slow moving layer, you&#x27;ve got the internet, TCP/IP, it hasn&#x27;t changed since 1974. We&#x27;d have to rip everything out and write everything from scratch. HTTP, protocols for emails and hypertext. We have HTTP2 now. It feels like it shouldn&#x27;t move too quickly. We put URLs on the web. Now, I would love it if URLs were down here at the bottom, here, and URLs never change. URLs absolutely change, disappear, they rot. We can fight against the rot and I think we should. What to you put at that URL? The obvious answer is hypertext with HTML. HTML has changed. When HTML was first created, borrowed all these tags from SGML, it was 25 26 tags\u00a0 elements, as we&#x27;d say today. And now there&#x27;s 100. The pace hasn&#x27;t been too quick. I feel like I&#x27;ve been able to keep up.</p><p>CSS, there&#x27;s more and more newer stuff coming in CSS, which is great, we have grid and Flexbox and all this other stuff. I feel like, this is good. I can keep on top of this. You know, follow the right blogs. Keep track of the right people. Then there&#x27;s the JavaScript language. Like, the libraries, the tools we use for JavaScript. This is like, I give up. That was so last week, we&#x27;ve switched over to last week. I can&#x27;t believe you&#x27;re still using that tool. Show of hands if anyone else feels like this with the pace of change with JavaScript. Keep your hands up and take a look around. You&#x27;re not alone. This apparently is the new normal.</p><p>What&#x27;s interesting, remember, fast learns, slow remembers. So, it&#x27;s kind of the point of JavaScript to go, what about this? What about that? The good stuff makes its way down. When I was first making things with JavaScript, the common uses were things like image rollovers, you mouse over something, the image changes. Or form validation. Is that actually an email address? Was that required field filled in? I used JavaScript to do that. Today, I would use CSS. I would use HTML, input type equals email required to do form validation. Fast learns, slow remembers. Those things filter down.</p><p>We needed a solution for responsive images, we figured it out in JavaScript and then the moves down into HTML. Mapping these things out helps me with feeling overwhelmed by the pace of change in JavaScript because I realized, it&#x27;s supposed to be that way. It&#x27;s meant to be trying new stuff and changing things quickly. If I want to go somewhere that&#x27;s slower moving, I can spend my time in one of those layers.</p><p>Something else I noticed, huh, this order of things, this layered structure, that&#x27;s kind of how I build websites, too, right? I assume the presence of the internet. You know, okay, URL design, there&#x27;s a place to start. I think that&#x27;s a great place to start designing something and then thinking about the structure of your content with HTML before thinking about the presentation and then adding JavaScript on top of that for the behavior and the really powerful stuff, right? This really maps to how I like to build, in layers.</p><p>However, it is a testament to the flexibility of the web that you don&#x27;t have to build this way. If you want to, you don&#x27;t have to use all the layers. You can, if you wish\u00a0build like this. You can assume the presence of the internet and everything on top of that, do it all in Javascript, URLs, routine, do it in JavaScript. CSS, in JS, please. Everything on top of that. This is literally the architecture of single page apps, right? You can use this architecture, rather than using the layered architecture. Now personally, I don&#x27;t like this architecture, it doesn&#x27;t sit right with me. I&#x27;ll tell you why, you&#x27;ve kind of turned this into a single point of failure, where if you got JavaScript, everything is great. If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ve got nothing. It works great or it doesn&#x27;t work. Something happens in the network, you get absolutely nothing.</p><p>This binary way of thinking between something doesn&#x27;t work at all or it works great makes total sense in other mediums. If you&#x27;re building a native app for a phone, you&#x27;re building an iOS app and I have a device, great. I get 100% of what you&#x27;ve designed and built. If you&#x27;re building an app and I have an Android device, I get 0% of what you&#x27;ve designed and built. So that mind set makes total sense in a lot of software situations, but not on the web. On the web, it is possible for us to build like this, where we can build in layers.</p><p>When something goes from not working at all, to just about working, to working really well to working great. You might design something and maybe because of the device I&#x27;m using or my browser or my network, I don&#x27;t get 100% of what you designed or built, but I won&#x27;t get 0%. Maybe I get 80%, maybe I get 90%. I feel like that&#x27;s better than the binary situation. What&#x27;s really nice about this approach of building on the web is it maps so well to the technologies we use for building on the web, a layered approach. I&#x27;m not the only one who thinks this way.</p><p>Ethan Marcotte says, I like designing in layers. I like looking at the design of a page, a pattern, whatever and think about how it will change if fonts aren&#x27;t available or JavaScript doesn&#x27;t work or if anyone doesn&#x27;t see the design like you and I might and is having the page read aloud to them. It&#x27;s anticipating the unexpected. We all know Ethan from writing a list called Responsive Web Design. And Ethan begins his article by quoting John&#x27;s article, by building on top of it, another layer, if you will.</p><p>And this term that Ethan comes up with, responsive web design, it was borrowed directly from architecture. In architecture, there&#x27;s a school of thought called responsive design, responding to the people within them. Architecture, actually a pretty rich seam for metaphors and language to describe our work. There&#x27;s another area of work that we&#x27;ve borrowed, we&#x27;ve taken from, so that will do very nicely. That&#x27;s when we describe ourselves as engineers, software engineers. Now, I will admit, I have a soft spot for the term &quot;software engineering,&quot; not because of the words itself, not the metaphor, but where it comes from. Hamilton, she coined this term &quot;software engineer.&quot; She wrote the code for the Apollo command, that was woven into the computers for the greatest endeavor. I think of software, hardware and human beings working together to get human beings on to the moon, absolutely amazing.</p><p>By the way, I should point something out about this particular picture. You&#x27;re familiar with the selfie, a self portrait photography popular with the youth. This is an &quot;everyone elsie.&quot; The only person not in the picture is\u00a0Michael is not in this picture. It is an everyone elsie. So, engineering, software engineering, if you&#x27;re sending people to the moon, yeah, that does feel like engineering. There&#x27;s chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, industrial engineering. Strangely, what unites these various disciplines to follow this engineering umbrella, I think it&#x27;s the fact that you got\u00a0what you&#x27;re working with is the materials that you&#x27;re working with and the tools that you use to work with those materials.</p><p>I think the materials of the web are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. That&#x27;s what the end users are going to get. Now, what tools you use to design and build on the web, there&#x27;s graphic design tools, Photoshop. You open up a Photoshop document, you put in a width and a height and you&#x27;re thinking back in the killer website constrained way. These are obvious tools to build with. There are less obvious tools when working on a web project. We have to communicate whether it&#x27;s email or Slack or calendars or meetings. These are productivity tools. But when you think about it, it&#x27;s an oxymoron because that&#x27;s what a tool is, all tools are productivity tools. That&#x27;s what tools do.</p><p>I think we should acknowledge, these are also tools that are necessary to build something. Let&#x27;s dive deep into specifically, what about when we&#x27;re developing? There&#x27;s a whole bunch of tools we can use. Version control and task runners, build tools, pipelines, pre processes, post processors. I&#x27;ve lumped all of these together because what they share in common, they sit on your computer and they&#x27;re productivity tools. They&#x27;re there to help you work faster. The end user doesn&#x27;t see any of that. You can say, oh, yeah, because we work faster, there&#x27;s a benefit to the end user, not directly. So when it comes to these things, because they sit on your computer, use whatever you want. Use whatever makes sense to you or your team. Like, that should be the defining factor.</p><p>I will admit, again, like with the JavaScript ecosystem, I&#x27;m a bit overwhelmed with the pace of change. You&#x27;re still using that particular task runner? We changed last week to this new one. It feels like maybe some\u00a0 I understand, you&#x27;re working at scale and you need these complicated tools. Does it always have to be that way? Does it always have to be so complicated? What it reminds me of, that startup, Juicero? It was a really expensive machine and you&#x27;d buy the expensive machine and put the expensive packets of juice into the machine and you got juice. It did what it was supposed to do, it made juice. You could just squeeze the packet by hand. I&#x27;m just saying, you can just squeeze the packet by hand. I&#x27;m being disingenuous. So, this is where the metaphor breaks down. I&#x27;m going to leave that.</p><p>As well as the materials and the tools. When you&#x27;re choosing those kind of tools, your task runners, use whatever works for you. There&#x27;s a whole class of tools where that isn&#x27;t true, the tools that are written themselves. If you&#x27;re using CSS, you&#x27;re making the user download the framework so you, the developer, get the benefit. If you use a JavaScript framework, you&#x27;re making the user download it. If you use it on the server side, it&#x27;s sitting on your computer. Just pointing that out. The tools that are built into materials and delivered to the end user, you cannot say, hey, whatever works best for you. You must consider the needs of the users, over the needs of the engineers.</p><p>At the very least, there&#x27;s a balance to be had there and I would rather wait the balance in terms of users than engineers.</p><p>Hey, I like developer experience as much as the next developer, but user needs, they&#x27;ve got to come first.</p><p>Now, when you&#x27;re choosing tools, there&#x27;s a lot of questions you can ask about, is this an appropriate tool? Is this going to help me? And one thing to ask is, well, how well does it work? That&#x27;s the obvious question. Something to ask especially if it&#x27;s going to be for the end user, not how well does it work, but how well does it fail? What happens when things don&#x27;t go perfectly? And now we&#x27;re back to that situation of the single point of failure, right? If you&#x27;re building in that binary where it&#x27;s the internet or binary, it works great or doesn&#x27;t work at all.</p><p>This layered approach to building fails really well. Something does go wrong. You know, one of these whole layers or within the layer, you use some CSS that isn&#x27;t supported in every browser. It&#x27;s fine. Use HTML that isn&#x27;t 100% supported, that&#x27;s fine. These technologies fail well, which brings us to something interesting. JavaScript&#x27;s the more powerful technology, it doesn&#x27;t fail as much as HTML. This is kind of good example of a principle, a law of nature that was underlying the creation of the web itself. The principle of least power. Which states that you should choose the least powerful language suitable for a given purpose. That seems a bit weird on the surface. Why would I choose the least powerful language? It will probably last longer, less prone to failure. Derek puts it this way: In the front end stack, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Aria, if you can solve it simpler, you should. Yes, you want to build a clickable button, you could do that with JavaScript or just use a button. The lazy solution is a better one, that&#x27;s a classic example of the principle of least power.</p><p>I think this matters on the web when it runs into another law of nature and that is Murphy&#x27;s Law. Anything that can possibly go wrong, will go wrong. Edward, aerospace, no one ever died on his watch. Right? I think we&#x27;re a bit quick to say, everything will be done. Edge cases. Can you imagine if other industries do that. Car manufacture companies, they strap dummies in the cars and crash them. They&#x27;re considering these situations, trying to make things safer, they will fair well. Can you imagine if they went, hey, we&#x27;ve been looking at the data and we&#x27;re going to stop crashing these cars. They are being driven by humans and on roads and not being smashed into walls at high speed. Yes, of course, that&#x27;s the happy path. That&#x27;s the situation we hope for. You hope for the best and you prepare for the worst and we are not preparing for the worst edge case.</p><p>Like cars, designed to perform in extreme heat or on icy roads websites should be built to face the reality of the web&#x27;s inherent variability. Reality, the web&#x27;s inherent variability. Exactly what John was talking about 19 years ago. Whenever there&#x27;s a discussion about engineering, bridges come up. I&#x27;m going to talk about a particular bridge. This is the Quebec Bridge, construction started in 1904, after there was an architecture competition. Theodore Cooper was in charge and lengthened the bridge from 490 meters to 550 meters. Mostly because he wanted it to be longer than the bridge. The longest bridge in the world. But he didn&#x27;t calculate the already high stresses being put on the steel. He wasn&#x27;t based in Quebec, he was based in New York. When the idea was put forward that other people could double check his numbers, he really didn&#x27;t like that. There would be no code reviews on this project.</p><p>So, construction&#x27;s happening, it&#x27;s 1907. An August 6, an engineer noticed there&#x27;s bending starting to happen. He sees it again on the 27th of August. It&#x27;s gotten worse. They&#x27;re informing Cooper and Cooper does send a telegram and says, place no more load on Quebec Bridge. They didn&#x27;t know how to interpret it and they kept working. It was right before the end of work, like, the whistle was just about to blow when the bridge collapsed and 75 of the 86 workers died. Something interesting started happening in Canada, years later, it&#x27;s 1925, Canadian engineering schools started holding a private ceremony. This was the ritual of the calling of the engineer. You&#x27;d speak in obligation. And you&#x27;d be given an iron ring. A symbol, a metaphor of pride, yes, but also, humility. You&#x27;d wear it on the little finger of your working hand so it would brush against the paper or the keyboard and be there as a constant reminder of responsibility. And that&#x27;s why I take issue with us just deciding to call ourselves &quot;engineers.&quot;</p><p>You haven&#x27;t earned it. So, what do we do? What do we call ourselves architects? Engineers? Developer&#x27;s not bad. I think maybe we got it right back in the geo cities days when we just talked about building things. We&#x27;re building, just like brick laying. Collaborating together to make things. I mean, is that so bad? That we work together and we build. Maybe it&#x27;s not engineering. Maybe it&#x27;s not architecture. But Christopher Alexander did say, most of the wonderful places of the world were not made by architects, but by the people. Maybe? I don&#x27;t mind thinking of myself as a bricklayer. Not when we&#x27;ve got such amazing bricks to work with. It&#x27;s a metaphor again, but think about the web. Hypertext. The link. What an amazing brick. The link is. I can make a page at a URL and I can link to another URL. And some other URL over there and that combination of links has never existed before in the history of the web? That&#x27;s an amazing thing. That&#x27;s kind of magical.</p><p>I think we forget the magic. I honestly think it is the next step in our civilization. We&#x27;ve gone from language and writing and the printing press to the world wide web and hypertext, it&#x27;s the next layer on top of all those layers. And, that we can choose to build amazing things.</p><p>I&#x27;ll finish with this story. A traveler comes across three workman, building something. The first worker, what are you doing there? He says, I&#x27;m, you know, stacking stones. Okay. Bricks. He says to the second worker, what are you doing? I&#x27;m making a wall. They&#x27;re all doing the same thing, but they give different answers. I&#x27;m making a wall, stacking bricks. He says to the third builder, what are you doing? I&#x27;m making a cathedral. Maybe it&#x27;s less about how we describe ourselves and much more about what we build together. We are bricklayers.</p><p>And over the last two days, you&#x27;ve heard from some really amazing brick layers, people who are building websites and web apps, building browsers, building businesses, building communities, building the web. What an honor and a privilege to be involved. After two days, my mind is full. I feel like we need to stop now so I&#x27;m going to stop moving my jaw up and down and flapping the fleshy piece of meat in my mouth and simply say, thank you.</p>",

You&#x27;ll see a lot of that from me. I&#x27;m super stoked to be here. I kind of came from music. And I had friends of mine who had come through Amsterdam quite often on performances and whatnot. And I used to just kind of dream of being out here. And when I had an opportunity to come out for this time around, I was just like, I absolutely have to go to this one venue because a bunch of my friends perform here. And I don&#x27;t know how to pronounce this. If anyone is from Amsterdam. Or is Dutch. Bimhuis? I don&#x27;t know. Whatever it is.</p><p>But it&#x27;s a gorgeous venue. It&#x27;s actually not too far from here. I plan on walking by and checking it out. Like I said, a lot of my friends performed there, and I was super jealous. I did what all sort of like successful musicians do, is quit and make money and become a developer. Yes, my name is Henri, last is not Helvetica. It&#x27;s a non plume. But people gravitate toward it. That&#x27;s my Instagram handle, if you want to see me do nothing on Instagram. I am from Toronto. I love it there. It&#x27;s super multi cultural.</p><p>I tend to work in the performance space like Ruth said. And run a couple meetups. One is the performance meetup and one I started out of interest, which is the jam stack one. And as you can tell, I&#x27;m a professional bodybuilder. That&#x27;s what I do in my spare time. All jokes aside, I partake in some activities. I like to run. And in fact, one of my heroes is Sifan Hassan. She is a Dutch resident. She ran the 10,000 meter and won. I was stoked. A big fan of hers. And in fact, I got to meet her for the first time this summer. This was in California. I&#x27;m keeping with Europe rules.</p><p>Because GDPR, the whole right to be forgotten kind of thing. Is that how it goes? Yeah. That is not me. Apparently. Nonetheless, I&#x27;m here at View Source. To the View Source people, thank you very much for having me for the second time. I loved it the first time around. That was a fantastic experience. So, I want to thank you for having me this time around as well. And we&#x27;re gonna talk about what I believe is a pretty safe statement. Or a correct one. The web is in a great place. Some of you may have some disagreements potentially. But I&#x27;m going to tell you why I believe it is what it is right now. So, let&#x27;s talk about the web. Web&#x27;s been around 30 years and we more or less know that.</p><p>But do you know what you were doing 30 years ago? Some of you may not have been around, some were super young like myself. But 30 years ago, this band right here put out their greatest record, this is Motley Crue. And they put out a record called Dr.\u00a0Feelgood, their greatest accomplishment. 30 years ago, we had this great cartoon.</p><p>Can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s been 30 years and change. But on record, it&#x27;s one of the greatest around. And we had one of the greatest disappointments in music history right here. Milli Vanilla, it was a great ruse. And people were getting on the web. Shortly after that, I got one of these things. Which is obviously a modem. It allowed me to do a thing like this, go to newsgroups.</p><p>Newsgroups, that&#x27;s what I consider the original social network. Oh, dude, I&#x27;ll trade you mix tapes or whatever. You did that. I did this, went to Alta Vista, my favorite search engine. Shoutout to the people from the big G in the building. And I used this, Netscape navigator. Which was one of the first browsers I was introduced to. It did everything I needed it to do and I loved it. Side note, I go to California ever so often. I have family out there. I was super stoked and went and drove to the original offices of Netscape and sat in front of the address and took a photo.</p><p>I don&#x27;t know why, but I thought it was so cool. And that&#x27;s 650 Castro, Mountain View, California. I like them so much, this is my avatar. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s him, I don&#x27;t see a face. That actually is me. But when Netscape was released, this statement was made. This software is going to change everything. I mean, you probably had a decent idea that it was going to do something all right. But to further things, the original PM on Java, Kim Polese added this, things started exploding with the convention of the browser because suddenly the Internet was accessible to the average person.</p><p>That was true, they were getting a modem, getting a dumpy computer, maybe had one already, and accessed the net. We had 65 million users in 18 months. That was an adoption rate never seen before. So much so that the people at Microsoft were clutching their pearls, what&#x27;s going on here? Fast forward to today, that&#x27;s 4.5 billion users online. That&#x27;s around 50%. Man, that&#x27;s like a large number. Like, what&#x27;s going on? How are things progressing so quickly that so many people would be online? Now, there are a lot of things in business that happen that are kind of like happy accidents or things you just could not predict that go extremely well. Like Velcro. Like Viagra.</p><p>Oooo... one thing no one predicted was the mobile phone. One, it was going to be created, second, it was going to be as powerful as it is. Some people have said before, some of these phones are more powerful than the technology that took people to space. And that&#x27;s really important because that also drove the adoption. And the adoption was so strong that you had moments like these. And this is one picture that I actually love talking about. Because you&#x27;re talking about a community that generally has shunned all things technology. You know? It&#x27;s like, manual, you know, mowing the lawn. It&#x27;s like\u00a0but somehow, they have a smartphone. This is another powerful picture that I like to sort of parade around.</p><p>Now, think about this. You&#x27;re talking about remote locations, you&#x27;re talking about suspect connectivity. But they&#x27;re actually on a phone. Now, it might not be a smartphone. It might be a feature phone, but they&#x27;re actually on a phone. And they have access to the Internet. And like I said, it might be a feature phone, because we&#x27;ve seen a little bit of resurgence in that area of sort of like devices. And in fact, whoops. Does this work? All right. This is a quote that I lifted from an interview with Mike Taylor where he talked about, and I think he&#x27;s in the room somewhere, still a lot of feature phones out there on the market, tons of people are using them\u00a0 using these phones right now.</p><p>And this is absolutely correct. You&#x27;re talking about areas of the globe where, you know, these moderate to low power devices are the ones that people are picking up due to price points. These things are very important. But they&#x27;re actually able to get on the net. So, what are we doing with some of these phones? Whether it be feature, but especially with the smartphones? What can we do today in 2019? Well, we can do a lot of different things.</p><p>Like we might go on a date. Online dating is big. I&#x27;ve never partaken, but I hear it is. And to go on this date, might get dressed up. Online shopping. And rent a car to go on this date. Here, a Chevy Impala. We might listen to Tame Impala while we&#x27;re on the device on the date. And go ahead and order Uber Eats online and eat empanadas. See what I did there? But there&#x27;s so much more you can do.</p><p>And what I want to do in the next little bit, we&#x27;re gonna talk about what I feel is the shape of the web. The technology, the technologists that are gonna be involved in making things a little better along the way. So, one thing I like to talk about, and how important this is, is collaboration. Collaboration is key in a lot of different industries and it absolutely will be in the web for sure. We have frontend developers, that&#x27;s for sure. Any backend developers in the room? Not that I can see. All right. Be proud. Throw that hand up. We obviously have designers. Designers are important in this process. We have user experience professionals. We also have author experience people.</p><p>This is something that I picked up a couple weeks ago. I was at a conference and someone mentioned author experience. I was like, what is that? But the CMS developers talk about the author experience because they need to create tools for the authors who are then also releasing product out there for users in the end. So, at the end of the day, all of these people work together to create a proper developer experience. Then in the end that comes out as a good product for the user. I think it&#x27;s actually dope. I think it&#x27;s an amazing process. And, again, for short, I&#x27;m just going call it dope. But speaking of dope. Let&#x27;s talk about dope.</p><p>Who has heard of a language here called &quot;dope&quot;? All right. I didn&#x27;t think so. It was a failed language. But it was a language, nonetheless. It stood for Dartmouth Oversimplified Programming Experiment. Like I said, a failed language. And it was released by this gentleman right here. His name was John Kemeny. Hungarian mathematician. Was a professor at the University of Dartmouth. He believed that he could put a team of STEM and non STEM people together with the goal of getting non STEM students to get into programming. And he felt that this could definitely happen.</p><p>Because DOPE, the language, was something that he was basically working on that was going to do that. Get non STEM types into programming. So, he had these teams work together, collaborate. And eventually they released another version of the program. Or programming language. And that was called BASIC. Who here has heard of BASIC? Or used BASIC? All right. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m talking about. BASIC I consider a success. BASIC was a collaborative effort. And as you know, it became the big language that it was. It was seen as what many will now call an aligned team. And this is a quote from his daughter. It was a successful project as a collaborative effort.</p><p>I mentioned the meetups. Why? Because, I mean, most of us probably attend meetups at some point. I believe that the best meetups out there, some meetups are poorly attended, some moderately. The best meetups are going to be the collaborative efforts. You know? I may have a speaker who deals in mobile. But he also deals, I don&#x27;t know, in React Native. And I may reach out to the React meetup and say, hey, let&#x27;s come together and great a better meetup for the developers so they can all take something back. Again, a collaborative effort with a success at the end. That is going to be the shape of the web.</p><p>I like to talk about respect as well. Having respect for developers. Imagine that. How about we talk about things like documentation? Writing proper documentation. Who here has had to read some whacky docs in the past? Yeah. I thought so. I&#x27;m just gonna leave this one up here. You have good docs. People will talk about them. People talk about your good docs. People will start reading them. So, next year I&#x27;m going to\u00a0I have been invited to a conference. It&#x27;s going on in Atlanta. And can someone tell me what the date of the conference is gonna be? Yeah, I thought so.</p><p>A developer said that the main problem is when the whole interface doesn&#x27;t work very well with your culture. And he was talking about specifically dealing with countries outside of North America of like the English speaking countries. And we&#x27;re talking about specifically i18n. What most will call internationalization. How important is that? Well, [Speaking in French]\u00a0who understood that? A few of you. But the majority didn&#x27;t. Now, imagine that. Imagine getting some documentation that just looks like lorem ipsum. You&#x27;re just gonna drop that. This is a quote they lifted off a Microsoft site. One of the many pages that they have. But it hit the nail. With the growing software market far beyond the English speaking language, English speaking world, it&#x27;s important for the software to support various text formats to reach all the potential customers.</p><p>But, I mean, it&#x27;s a language thing at the end of the day. Wes Bos a couple weeks ago released a bunch of information about some of the people who are picking up on his courses and etcetera, etcetera. And he was stunned at the amount of users he had beyond the English speaking nations. And he shared it online. It was very insightful. Here he&#x27;s talking about having some of the users in Africa. And then he released some additional data here. And if you look at the top 25, you know, you could count the native English speaking countries on one and a half hands. Maybe two.</p><p>Now, I get back to this photo again. This is why I like to circulate this photo. Think about what is happening beyond our shores. Now, let&#x27;s look at the number of Internet users across the globe. So, number one, China through number ten, Mexico. USA is in there. Where are the English speaking countries? Let&#x27;s look at the greatest growth. Egypt through India. Where are the English speaking countries?</p><p>Now, I&#x27;ll tell you this much. For all the Spanish speaking countries, GitHub is ready. They recently announced they have some documentation entirely in Spanish. Ready for these territories, ready for these new developers. Let&#x27;s talk about internationalization in real life. On my way here yesterday, ran into a developer from Toronto. I think he&#x27;s somewhere in the room here. And he talked about growing up and playing around with computers. And playing around with a bit of programming. But around his area, he was the only one who was able to. Why was that? He was taking some English classes because he had a tutor. So, he was the only one in a group of kids who were all interested in software or programming or maybe, you know, playing around with BASIC back then.</p><p>But he was the only one who knew what to do because he had a tutor and he was learning English at the time. I think that&#x27;s totally wild. And before I get into this point right here, I want to talk about the fact that, and this is something that I believe Bruce said,\u00a0he talks about, where is your next user coming from? I&#x27;ll go a step further and say, where is your next developer coming from? That&#x27;s why the documentation is important. Proper documentation, proper translation.</p><p>That&#x27;s going to be the future, the shape of the web. So, let&#x27;s talk about developer diversity. And I know what you&#x27;re thinking right now. But it goes beyond that. I mean, I&#x27;ll start with this. Women in technology. We know. You know, we have to celebrate wins. You know, do not go out and necessarily, you know, question their accomplishments. You know, that was actually pretty cool. You know, you want to test their acumen somehow. No, man, they did it. They know how to program. Shoutout to Tejas who reminded me about this. Yes, I hang out in the performance circles. I know who this is.</p><p>Hands up if you know the name Lena. A few of you do. But if you hang out in performance, we talk about images, we talk about image processing, we talk about compression. Somehow this is the photo that became the standard photo for that kind of research. You might think it&#x27;s totally cool. All right. Well, this is Lena when she was in her 20s. She&#x27;s like a retired person now. But this picture was picked up on a whim one day, you know. Someone was going to do a presentation. Was kind of sick and tired of looking at the same photos he had all the time. He grabbed a magazine, flip, flip, flip, flip, oh I&#x27;m gonna use that. You might think that&#x27;s pretty innocent. It kind of was. Until you find out that it came from a Playboy. 40 years ago. But somehow it remained the standard image unofficially. So much so that people started to ridicule the idea that a centerfold just remained\u00a0a centerfold from the &#x27;70s remained the standard photo.</p><p>And I argued a few years ago that this photo should just be retired. Because you talk about 2 million photos, 2 billion photos uploaded to the net every day. But somehow you still want to use a Playboy centerfold. I don&#x27;t think these ready things of things that are really respectful of the people that we work with.</p><p>Let&#x27;s talk about cultural diversity. I mean, I&#x27;m from Toronto, I&#x27;m Canadian. Canada is going through things with the prime minister. In his younger days, he was wild and out. But these are important. Respecting the cultural diversity of your team. And you talk about, oh, man, you know, you&#x27;re gonna have such an advantage. But having like a cultural, a culturally sort of like diverse team of developers. Well, how about just being like a cool person?</p><p>First. Let&#x27;s talk about language diversity. And I&#x27;m specifically talking about things like CSS versus JS and the ongoing battles that are going on there. Which I think are hilarious. But specifically, I think the way some developers kind of malign CSS thinking like, oh, no, no. That&#x27;s no big deal. That&#x27;s just CSS. Now, I love this quote from Rachel Andrews. I&#x27;m not sure if she&#x27;s here, but due to be around this weekend. CSS is too trivial for real developers to worry about, yet too difficult for them to understand. How about we just have respect for everyone and their specialties? You&#x27;re good at JS. That&#x27;s awesome. You&#x27;re fantastic at CSS. Great. You have a knack for HTML, fantastic.</p><p>I remember Chris Core used to say, he felt there was room to employee someone who was just absolutely brilliant in CSS. Think about how complicated CSS has become these days. And complicated not in like in a bad way, but just it&#x27;s fantastic the way CSS has evolved and the things that you can do with it. Let&#x27;s start respecting the people who sort of like, you know, are skilled in that craft. And respecting these people is the shape of the web. Browser diversity. Ah. That&#x27;s gonna be a good one. You know, we got the heavy weights here today. You know, I know Samsung&#x27;s here, shoutout, Google. Microsoft came through with the troops. I saw them downstairs. Shoutouts to Safari not here, WebKit, I shot them a little email. You know, they&#x27;re caught up. It&#x27;s all good.</p><p>But I know Mike Taylor, again, I think he&#x27;s here. I believe he&#x27;s gonna talk about this throughout the two days. But browser diversity is important. And you know what? Long before, maybe not long before, but right around the time there was, you know, a browser war, or the first one as you want to call it, there was another war going on. Bam! Aw, yeah. I know a few of you are like, I remember this one. VHS versus Betamax. And, you know, unfortunately VHS won out the battle. Even though a lot of people believed that Betamax was a better product.</p><p>Hopefully we won&#x27;t end up with just like, you know, all of us using UC browser or something of the sort. But browser diversity is important. We&#x27;re gonna hear from some people who are gonna talk about it. Making sure that we have a diverse set of browsers is going to be the shape of the web. Also, open source. Super important. Any WordPress developers in the building? Don&#x27;t be shy. Throw your hands up. We got love for you. Even though your days are numbered. I&#x27;m just playin&#x27;. But you run about 35% of the web. Who worked on jQuery here? Don&#x27;t be shy. We love you too. Celebrated 13 years out there. Number one framework out there to this day. Obviously, some antiquated work. But it&#x27;s out there. And, you know, it&#x27;s there. And obviously, you know, React is out there. I know, I know, I know, React, React, React. But guess what? They&#x27;re all open source. But also, hey! Thank you for having me.</p><p>All right. I mean, they&#x27;re doing God&#x27;s work. Let&#x27;s go. Specifically, you know, it is the act of collaboration across an open platform which is essential to individual growth and the collective future. The collective future. Out of the 12,000 contributors to Firefox, over\u00a0just about 750,000 contributions - just under 10% were code. So, what does that mean? We have a collaborative team of people building a product. Not all developers. Not all designers. I mean, I can get into the weeds as to who did what. But these are important moments. And moments like these are the shape of the web. Now, believe it or not, I&#x27;m gonna speed through this deck.</p><p>Performance is going to be important. We&#x27;re going to hear about it. There&#x27;s a couple of talks. There&#x27;s a tooling talk, there&#x27;s a talk, is it fast yet? Speed is important. You&#x27;re going to be working in territories where connectivity is kind of suspect outside of the G7s. Connectivity is not gangster. You know, we&#x27;re gonna get into things where we demand fast responses. You know, all these acronyms like TTFB, FCP, LCP, that&#x27;s a new one. Things like the speed index. You know, all of these performance APIs. And I think the best thing right now about, you know, browsers, specifically, is that the new APIs, the adoption across the clients is getting faster and faster.</p><p>Once upon a time, it was a particular client, yeah, we&#x27;re go to do this. And eight months later, okay, we&#x27;re gonna come aboard. All times are reducing. All users are having a better experience. I mean, I like to talk about image formats all the time. I mean, these things are being researched as we speak today. There&#x27;s a format they&#x27;re talking about called the JPEG XL. Just when you thought the JPEG had seen the variants, we&#x27;re working on a new one. The JPEG XL. A few of you have heard of the WebP, maybe? Maybe not? Supported by Firefox. Supported obviously by Chrome. By the way, the WebP turns 9 today, I believe. I&#x27;ll have to double check. But I believe it&#x27;s an anniversary today.</p><p>These are important moments in the future of the web. The shape of the web. Because we want to make sure that the web is as fluid and smooth as possible. And image formats&#x27; performance are gonna be part of that solution. You know, a lot of people are using Lighthouse these days which is fantastic. You&#x27;re talking about a product that&#x27;s seen some great adoption despite the fact we have been beating the performance drum for a while. People are saying, hey, my Lighthouse score is this. That&#x27;s fantastic. Did you know the median Lighthouse score is 41?</p><p>There&#x27;s work to do. Hello. There&#x27;s going to be tooling talks. I think there might be one today, in fact. But you&#x27;ll have to double check the schedule. And, of course, it would be tough for me to not mention at the very least privacy. Because that&#x27;s obviously top of mind these days. I know I was having this conversation about it. And the fact that there&#x27;s a challenge with privacy right now I think, again, is a bit of a testament to the success of the web in a sense that the challenges we&#x27;re having with privacy are only happening because the web is fully here. It is fully established.</p><p>Now we just have to wrangle the challenges of tracking and all that. So, that leaves us with these two words &quot;The web.&quot; Are we in a good place? Again, I argue that we are. And I&#x27;ll tell you why. Despite the fact that, and I love this quote because it came from like a\u2026.I was watching the news. And, oh, what&#x27;s her name? She was like a political candidate. But the dark psychic forces of privacy. Yes. They&#x27;re here. Absolutely. And it&#x27;s tough. But we&#x27;re gonna hear about it again this week.</p><p>We have speakers like Diane Hosfelt and Ryan Cropp and Wendy Seltzer who are going to talk about privacy. But it is weird. I&#x27;m going to share a story. Last year at the View Source, in fact, I was having a side conversation about there was once upon a time there was a company that sold like rubber boots and tires. They&#x27;re called Nokia. They also sold phones. But we talked about this super old phone that they had called the Virtue, blah, blah, blah. It was super expensive. I never knew anybody else who knew about it. Blah, blah, blah. It popped up in my feed, it was antiquated. It was nowhere near the market anymore. It was in my feed. This privacy and tracking stuff is absolutely bananas.</p><p>But we will talk about it the next few days and we&#x27;ll be able to figure out what we can do. And one of the few semi blemishes of the web. So, when it comes to sort of like measuring the successes of the web, I would like to quote a gentleman by the name of Jason Lengstorf who used to work at Gatsby who has a great program, learning with JSON, right now. And I love this quote if you want to talk with metrics. Community as a primary metric is what you should be looking at. And I think it&#x27;s absolutely true. If you have engagement with your product, that&#x27;s the community responding. That&#x27;s a fantastic way to gauge what&#x27;s happening. You have fantastic framework adoption. That&#x27;s the community responding. Why? Because you may have had proper translation so people in other countries were able to sort of pick up on it and adopt this framework faster than they would have prior.</p><p>You get people bragging about their Lighthouse score. Again, that&#x27;s the community responding because somehow you have been able to create these conditions that they can sort of like work with the tooling, get the results they want and go out and get on Twitter and say their things. So, that being said, I think the web is absolutely in great shape. The fact that my parents, my dad, especially, can get online and brag about how he updated his insurance. Or he bought his ticket for this 60 day trip he&#x27;s going on with my mom, you know, across the world. The idea that, you know, on\u00a0across two days here in Amsterdam, we&#x27;re gonna have a multitude of DevRels, we&#x27;re gonna have PMs all here talking about all things web. I think that&#x27;s fantastic. I know we&#x27;re gonna have\u00a0a talk about, I believe, AR. And I remember thinking about AR like, oh, yeah. I remember that.</p><p>And, again, I came from music. I remember holding up a CD in front of my laptop camera one day. And out of nowhere these exclusive music files showed up on my desktop. I was like, what the hell just happened here? And I&#x27;m thinking to myself, man, the technology involved with voodoo these days is amazing. But I was wrong. That was the web at work. So, that being said, I think we&#x27;re all gonna be here. We&#x27;re gonna have an amazing two days. I&#x27;m really looking forward to having conversations with, you know, the Edge people in the building, I know some Google people in the building, I know some Samsung people in the building. And everything in between. I think the next two days we may get some decisions, some products may come out of it two months from now, six months from now. It may come out next year. But I know all the people here, all of us, are going to be here building better product. Building much better products for users in the end. And in the end, we are going to create better conditions and what I like to call a better shape of the web. So, thank you very much. And have yourself a ball.</p>",

		"transcript": "<p>Thanks, Henri, for getting us kicked off today. I love space there is for captions at this event. It&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;m Melanie Richards, a member of the web platform team on Microsoft Edge and I work with the CSS working group. The CSS working group has been developing integrations for web developer styling with user settings such as users high contrast. If you&#x27;re unsure, this is an accessibility feature that increases accessibility while decreasing cognitive load. It allows the user to set colors for a number of elements. These colors are applied to digital UI. So, this essentially pares down the UI while guaranteeing the user&#x27;s contrast level. Here we have Windows high contrast black. And you can see everything is pared down and it&#x27;s white text on a black background. Browsers like other apps can make sure that their UI is rendered in high contrast as well as web content.</p><p>In with the effort, was part of a usability study for how well it was working on the web. We had people with low vision go through sites with and without high contrast enabled. One individual in the original colors remarked, the text on the blue background is hard to read. Maybe this is some kind of shenanigans, maybe in a footer they have dark text on a dark background. But actually, the person was referring to black text on a white background. You cannot have a higher contrast ratio than this. And still, this individual&#x27;s eyes were picking up on the blue light in the screen. And they still found it a little bit tricky to read. So, we then turn on, you know, a dark high contrast theme and the same person said, that&#x27;s much better. So, this is actually the same exact contrast ratio as the previous slide. It&#x27;s in a color scheme that was easier for this person to read.</p><p>So, in web design and development, we put a lot of energy into making some one true design as beautiful and useful and pleasant for as many people as possible is often our goal. But the truth is our users bring with them highly individualized needs for color and contrast. And these can change by the day or even the hour. So, maybe someone had a recent injury that makes it really hard to look at screens. Especially certain colors. Or they find that lower contrast helps them focus better. Or maybe up in the middle of the night trying to jam on a major project without keeping their partner up with the light from their screen. So, how are we supposed to manage all these needs and preferences at once with just one color scheme? Well, while we should provide reasonable defaults within our base theme, the truth is that we can take a layered approach to inclusive color and contrast on the web. Using emerging CSS qualities, we can respond to preferences such as preferred color scheme, preferred contrast level and the color modes like high contrast. We can use the new standards to officially tailor our websites to our user&#x27;s needs while also maintaining a design point of view. Let&#x27;s suppose that we are working on a marketing page for a service that sends you clothing tailored to your individual preferences.</p><p>And we want to create variances on our theme for the users. And I&#x27;m going to zoom in. We have a light theme with dark, cool accented colors. We have some mixed content here, including a sample color palette in the style profile. We&#x27;ve got gradients layered on top of photography. Some decorative borders. And form fields at the bottom of the page. So, there are a few related media queries that we will use in order to create the variations on this theme. And these are\u00a0 prefers color scheme, prefers contrast and forced colors. So, prefers color scheme is a hint to the user. This is highly correlated today with supporting darkmode. And prefers contrast is a hint to increase or decrease the contrast. Forced colors is a hint that the rendering engine has applied the user&#x27;s system colors to the web content. This can occur when Windows high contrast is active. There&#x27;s a couple different expectations on the web developer here, for prefers color scheme and prefers contrast, the expectation is that the website will fully manage the color scheme as well as any contrast levels and for forced colors, the expectation is these have been applied by the browser and the website just might want to optimize the design. So, let&#x27;s add an additional color scheme. As mentioned, prefers color scheme allows the web developer to respond to hints from the user as to which color scheme they might like.</p><p>So, this could be provided on the OS level, check boxes for light mode or dark mode. Or the browser could support the browser schemes. If it&#x27;s available on an OS that doesn&#x27;t support dark mode but wants this to be available to users. Let&#x27;s suppose that we want to support darkmode here. So, one strategy that actually makes this is way easier is to use CSS custom properties or known in the common parlance as variables. Instead of setting static colors all over our pattern library or wherever we have our stylesheets, we&#x27;re actually going to set some color variables on the root node here. So, for example, we have the background color set to white. And so, then we can use these throughout our styles instead of or in addition to the static colors. We&#x27;ll set our body background to background color main using the var syntax. And then we want to update these variables for darkmode. What we&#x27;re going to do is query for prefers color scheme dark. And then set our styles from within. So, there&#x27;s actually nothing that says thou shalt remove all color in darkmode. Although it is heavily associated with shades of gray. But in our example, we think that the blue color is really important to our brand. We&#x27;re going to do this up with shades of blue with the saturation turned down to make it easier to read in darkmode. For our prefered color steam dark query, is we are going to reset the color variables pseudo class bg color main is now a dark variable. We are not going to touch any other code. But these values are going to propagate to wherever we have used them.</p><p>So, now we have our page rendered in dark blue. And so, just by changing the color variable values, we&#x27;ve actually got most of our page styled in a matter of, I think this took me like 10 minutes? So, there are some things that we want to manually change. We didn&#x27;t use color variables for these gradient images. We&#x27;ll just manually change our CSS that way. And after the simple variable swap we actually think, maybe this box is too bright. So, we&#x27;ll change that manually as well. And our logo doesn&#x27;t look great either. It&#x27;s still being rendered in the dark color. This is an SVG logo. One of the things to make sure this logo is always rendered in the correct color is use current color in the logo. This will inherit the color from the surrounding context. It will get the color of the link. We&#x27;re actually going to do this inside\u00a0of our base theme instead of the media query. That way the color is inherited no matter what color scheme we&#x27;re in and that will pick up the color correctly. So, after doing this work to support dark theme across our page here, big bright images might actually end up detracting from what we have. So, we might choose to swap out imagery using sourceset media conditions. But in our case, we&#x27;ve decided, no, actually the photography we have here already is really important to our content. We&#x27;re just going to tweak it a little bit. So, what you could do is you could use the CSS filter property on your images to turn down the brightness a little bit, turn up the contrast a little bit to kind of make sure the colors don&#x27;t get muddy. And this is a very subtle change. But it does kind of help blend the photography a little bit with the rest of the page. So, we&#x27;ll notice that, you know, some of our form fields here are actually still rendered in the light mode theme. So, in order to fix this, we can use the CSS color scheme property and we can set that to light dark. And that basically tells the rendering engine that it&#x27;s safe to render user interactive controls and scrollbars in the dark theme. And we&#x27;re going to do this on our root node so that it propagates across the entire document to support across the document.</p><p>But actually, you could do this on individual elements. For example, if you are a use case, I have some user generated content in part of the document. I don&#x27;t want to color shift that. But I want to color shift the rest of the UI. That&#x27;s a little bit of flexibility that you have there, by making this change, now we can have our controls render in dark mode. So, we should also pair this with a meta tag that gives the browser rendering engine an early hint as to how it can render a page. This can prevent a flash of white or help mail apps do auto darkening if they choose to do so. The syntax for this is still under discussion in standards and you can find a reference that at the short link that I&#x27;ve provided here. So, AKA.ms/color scheme meta. And all these short links just send you over to standards environments. So, basically, we have been able to support darkmode on our page using 20 lines of code and in that number, I include selectors and any changes to the variables that we have here. And we&#x27;ve also changed one line of code. So, in additional considerations, you could consider a site level override. It&#x27;s possible someone prefers dark scheme for the rest of their ecosystem. But actually, prefers your site in a light color mode. I would consider this going the extra mile. But you could have a site setting that allows them to toggle this. And you could have that connected to a CSS selector that basically manages your darkmode styles.</p><p>So, there is a pretty good browser support for prefered color scheme media query across rendering engines. And the current meta tin tax is available in Safari 12.1 and above. And these metrics are all for desktop. So, now that we&#x27;ve got darkmode up and running on our site, let&#x27;s talk about querying for contrast. So, this is a hint that can likewise come from the user&#x27;s settings on the OS or otherwise. So, for example, if you&#x27;re on Mac OS and you click increase contrast and you&#x27;re in light mode, you&#x27;ll notice that the text gets darker and the borders get darker in order to stand out more from the background. This is something that we could pick up in our web styles. So, the proposed syntax here is prefers contrast. And the current values for this are no preference, high and low. But these values are actually still under discussion because some folks in the CSS working group were like, does this really align with how OS level settings work together?\u00a0So, we might, change to a different set of keyword values or maybe consider a numeric value. For this reason, we&#x27;re not going to talk about too much about this today because the guidance to web developers might change. But whenever this is available, there&#x27;s a few things you might to want focus on adjusting. Things like text, non decorative icons and imagery, backgrounds and decorations on interactive elements and other design elements that are important to understanding relationships or content. So, for some folks, a slight adjustment\u00a0to contrast or an art directed color scheme doesn&#x27;t quite meet their needs for legibility on the web. This is where force color modes come in. The new standards for force color modes are heavily influenced by the Windows high contrast as well as prior styling in IE and Microsoft Edge. It should be noted that it is a misnomer. While the inbox names are the most popular and guarantee higher contrast, user cans change them to whatever they want. This is helpful if you need colors differentiated from each other or ultimately the UI to render in softer contrast. No matter the reason for choosing Windows high contrast, this is far and away one of the most popular ease of access settings on Windows. Last time we checked, that was 4% of devices and that represents millions of people worldwide.</p><p>So, let&#x27;s explore how this works under the hood. So, we&#x27;ve set the OS into a high contrast black theme. And without doing any work on the web development end, we have our page rendering pretty well in high contrast. So, we&#x27;re getting the white text in the foreground. We&#x27;re getting a different color for the links. And we have this black background as well. And these colors are shifted throughout the page. Including native form controls. And so, let&#x27;s explore how this works under the hood. So, first, the rendering engine reverts the values of some properties and this includes any properties that are related to color as well as decorations that might interfere with text legibility. So, for example, box shadow and text shadow could make it hard to read edges or they might overlap on top of other elements. So, after this reverting of values, then the rendering engine applies the user&#x27;s colors. Basically, it has a user agent stylesheet where they are applied semantically. So, link color to link color, that kind of stuff. If we return to our reverted properties, what&#x27;s important to note as developers, if you use a reverted property to denote state, you might want to make adjustments and force color modes. So, for example, if you are using box shadow to denote a focus state.</p><p>And another point to call out here is that background image is only reverted in user interactive controls with the exception of buttons. And so, why not just like globally revert background image? It turns now the historical implementations that did do this, this causes problem what the web developer uses CSS to render images. So, for example, here is a feed of photography. Let the record show, there are no visible images on the screen right now. So, there&#x27;s many different reasons why people do this. This in particular was a historical performance hack. So, we, as rendering engines, need to make sure this content is available to people. How do we guarantee that text legibility while showing background images? And the solution we came up with in EdgeHTML and will be part of standard implementations is to render text back plates behind the text when in forced color modes. And so, basically this helps, you know, guarantee that the user has the correct colors, and this can be seen on top of, you know, anything that the text is layered on top of.</p><p>So, a new detail in standard implementations is that forced color modes\u00a0or prefered color scheme evaluates appropriately. What the rendering engine does, it looks at the page background color or the canvas color to determine if the force color mode is light or dark. And then it use this is to evaluate prefers color scheme correctly. So, in this case, we&#x27;re actually picking up in our gradient images here the colors that we set within our dark mode styles. Because we&#x27;re currently in a forced color steam that has a black background. So, SVGs are for the most part not modified in standard implementations. This is because we as rendering engines don&#x27;t always know how they should be shifted for these colors. Because SVGs can be very complex documents. So, the only pieces of SVG that are color shift ready SVG text as well as a foreign object, which essentially embeds HTML inside of SVG. And so, actually funnily enough, this is why our logo is in the correct color. Because in our base styles, we use current color for the strokes and the fills. So, it&#x27;s actually appropriately inheriting from the system link color that&#x27;s been provided here. So, browser rendering engines can get most of the way there by applying reasonable default to semantic content. But web developers know their content best and can apply that content specific knowledge to tailor the forced colors experience. So, let&#x27;s go through how to do that. You may have notice when had we scrolled through that we lost details in the palette profile. This is because we&#x27;re using background color to render the color palettes. You could use that, or force color modes ourselves. Let&#x27;s go ahead and do that.</p><p>We have a couple of requirements for our palette and forced color modes. So, we want to retain the color swatch. We want to make sure that we&#x27;re always rendering the color swatch on top of black or white. And we&#x27;re doing this because the user can set any color in forced color modes and we don&#x27;t want the color to look muddy on top of whatever the user set. And we want to preserve for text legibility. Start with the media query. The prior art is the ms high contrast media query. But in syntax, this is renamed to forced colors and change to the active value. The reason we renamed this was to future proof the colors. We want web developers to very efficiently style for any forced color mode, not just high contrast. Then we&#x27;ll want to opt out of forced colors for the component that we&#x27;re managing. This comes from the prior art of ms high contrast: Adjust none. In standards, this is forced color adjust none. And what this will do is remove all of the forced colors that the rendering edge has set. It will basically retain all of our colors for the component, its children and any text back plates that are involved. So, you&#x27;ll notice that our component now looks as it did in darkmode. And so, next we want to render the background of this component in black because we&#x27;re in a dark forced color scheme. Set that to black. But we want to be careful with static values in forced color modes. And the reason is not so obvious when we are using black in a black color scheme. But if we change this into say a purple user color scheme, then the static color is not aware of the change that the user made and it&#x27;s not rendering things in the user&#x27;s correct colors.</p><p>So, in order to make sure that the text on top of this is rendering in the user&#x27;s colors, we&#x27;re going to use system colors to guarantee legibility. We&#x27;re going to essentially create our own back plate here. We&#x27;ll set the background color of the span to canvas and set the foreground to text. And this way we are guaranteeing that we are using exactly the colors that the user chose. And now our component is complete as far as dark force color. And there are a few that are relevant when Windows high contrast is active. There is also link text for links, there is gray text for disabled text, and a couple additional keyword values for highlights and for buttons. And these are all up to date standard CSS system colors. You can find the full list of CSS system colors on the CSS Color Editor&#x27;s Draft. And the short link is aka months ms/system colors draft. And you&#x27;ll notice there&#x27;s a longer list on here than the previous slide.</p><p>Not every OS will be able to support every single system color. It&#x27;s important whenever you use these values that you test your content. So, as we mentioned, we want to either always render the background of our component in black or white. And so, we see that when we put the forced color mode in a light color scheme, we get the correct colors for the text. But the black background is a little too much in this mode, right? So, we want to change this to white in this case. What we can do is take a combinatorial approach in the new standards for modifying\u00a0this. Query for force colors: Active and light. And that&#x27;s evaluated appropriately and let the colors within the combinatorial query. In this page we are missing a little bit of detail here. In our base styles, we set the style of the button to border zero because we&#x27;re using background color to display this. But this causes problems in force color modes, for example, where the background color in the page background color are actually the same. You can&#x27;t see the bounds of this button. The user doesn&#x27;t know exactly where to click or even if it is a button. So, in order to fix this, we can change in our base styles the border to 1px solid transparent. We are getting the color in the base theme, the border is invisible, but we are getting the border appropriately drawn. So, in additional considerations, browsers are not in the business of changing styling by default based on ARIA roles and properties.</p><p>The expectation is if you are using ARIA to provide your own semantics on your component, then you are also managing keyword accessibility and styling as well. And so, this actually applies today in force color modes as it does in default context. You might to want test if you&#x27;re using any styling connected to ARIA. So, unless you do a whole lot of creating your own semantics and states and your own custom components, we actually expect that the work that you&#x27;ll have to do with optimizing for color modes is pretty minimal. I just threw a ton of information at you. But it&#x27;s worth noting that we only wrote 12 lines of code for the new standards over these past slides. And I&#x27;m including selectors in that number of lines. And we&#x27;ve got our page styled up. We also changed one line in the base theme as well. So, as far as browser support goes for forced color modes, the prefixed values are still supported in IE and Microsoft Edge today. And that&#x27;s versions of Microsoft Edge that are based on EdgeHTML. I make that distinction because the new standards are in development, and Chromium for new versions of Microsoft Edge. As well as the entire browser community that is based on this particular rendering engine. And we hope to be joined by other rendering engines in the future. So, it is worth noting that these standards are super, super new. We have been working on them in 2019.</p><p>But we think that they&#x27;ll be imminently ready for folks to start playing around with behind a flag soon. So, if you&#x27;re testing without a Windows machine, you can find free virtual machines at aka.ms/web vms. And in the future, cross platform browsers could have Dev tools to spoof web forms directly in the browser. You wouldn&#x27;t need a Windows machine or push your entire machine into high contrast mode in order to test these values. Just show of hands, would anybody be interested in such a Dev tool feature? Hands throughout. I hope you get to test in a forced color mode like high contrast. While we as browsers can get it most of the way there, you are the expert on your content and can give a truly well tailored experience on top of the web platform. These emerging CSS media queries and CSS properties can allow us to meet our users where they are. Whether they find that darkmode cuts down on eyestrain, or they need a specific color scheme in order to stay productive on the web. We can give them an inclusive and delightful experience. So, with these new standards in hand, let&#x27;s design a more inclusive and accessible web together. You can find my slides, my demo and other resources at aka .ms/viewsource color. And thank you very much.</p>",

		"transcript": "<p>High five. Thank you, thank you, thank you. So, the talk you&#x27;ll see has like an asterisk next to the J there because it&#x27;s a bit of a misnomer. We are going to talk about how JavaScript, the language, is standardized. But also, we&#x27;re gonna talk a little bit about the reasons why. The policy and the\u00a0kind of the business reasons that we do standardization in the way that we do.</p><p>So, it&#x27;s actually kind of like a little mini lecture in disguise. Pull out your textbooks to page 172. Just kidding, I have the teacher blazer on. Thought I would try that. A lot of you are aware that there is a group working on standardizing the language, JavaScript. That&#x27;s a committee of people called TC39. I&#x27;m really bad about throwing a lot of acronyms. So, I put that down there. So, TC39. Their next meeting starts tomorrow. You can follow along with the group&#x27;s activities on GitHub or on Twitter.</p><p>Raise your hands if you were aware that there&#x27;s a group called TC39. Yeah, it&#x27;s kind of a trod subject at this point. If you were aware of that, you would know that TC39 operates in a proposal process through which they take ideas and kind of craft proposals around them. They get vetted. They get tested. There&#x27;s documentation. It&#x27;s kind of this long four stage process which might eventually result in that idea becoming part of the standard. And that&#x27;s something that you can follow along with as well in the proposals repository. Click. Click. There we go. So, if you know that, I really hope you know that you can also submit proposals.</p><p>Anybody can submit a proposal. You can comment. You can weigh in on the issues. You can contribute tests. You can add your own use cases or otherwise provide feedback. That&#x27;s provided, of course, that you mind our code of conduct. I want to take a minute and point out our awesome new website which is TC39, which thanks to the Mozilla team actually put in a lot of hours on that. And you can check out these other awesome repositories as well that kind of describes this proposal process in more detail. Click. Click. So, you know those things.</p><p>Then you might also know that there are lots and lots of other web standards. Many of which we have been talking about today. There&#x27;s other specs, APIs, those sorts of things. That are driven by similar working groups and committees at other organizations like the W3C. Or what WG, Ecma at ITEF. There&#x27;s probably hundreds and hundreds of communities related to the web and Internet technologies. And they&#x27;re all working to develop a specification of some kind. Ideally into a standard.</p><p>So, if you know all of those things, then congratulations. Because knowing is half the battle! But if you want to learn more about TC39 specifically, then there are already some great talks online by my colleagues on the committee, Dan Ehrenberg, Myles, Julia and people object panel this get into the specific features of the process and how the process with TC39 works. But TC39 is just one of many working groups as we pointed out. And they work in a similar fashion to a number of other working groups. The next question you might be asking yourself, if TC39 proceeds in this way, why is it? Why do we do business this way? Because the processes, they are kind of complex. And they&#x27;re kind of hard to discover and they&#x27;re kind of opaque. It took me a really long time to internalize all of this stuff. Because it&#x27;s just a lot.</p><p>So, the next question I started asking was, why is it done this way? And what even does it matter. Because on the surface, the proceedings of a standards developing committee look a lot like sort of your routine open source development practices. If not perhaps a bit more procedural and a bit more pedantic. In both cases, you have ongoing maintenance of some kind. There&#x27;s a feature, a proposal process maybe. Decision making about that proposal. There&#x27;s ideally tests and documentation that go along with it. And, of course, everyone always agrees and there&#x27;s never any conflict. It&#x27;s a joke. One key difference, of course, is that in open source if we&#x27;re working on a codebase, usually. And in standards development, we&#x27;re trying to define behavior and algorithms for the people that will implement the standard.</p><p>If you continue to look even closer at the process, you start to run into other immediate and important differences about the development process. So, why are there members? Why are there delegates and invited experts and editors? Why do I have to sign a CLA and other paperwork? Why do I have to join a committee? Why does this process take so long? Why the process so different between organizations? These are great questions that highlight differences between standards development and open source.</p><p>And the answers I don&#x27;t think are obvious at all. And I think anecdotally they contribute to a lot of frustration is that developers have with the platform. So, if you&#x27;ve heard about all of these different ones, the W3Cs and whatnot. Today I want to talk about why. Where did these processes actually come from? What are they being used for? And why are they important in the first place? If these are subject matter that interests you, these are some of my favorite books and resources on that topic. I also made a TLA cheat sheet because there are lots of three letter acronyms in standards. That can be hard to follow.</p><p>So, feel free to open that up and follow along. Let&#x27;s do a lightning quick recap of the history of standards making. So, the first standards we ever made actually had to do with power and money. I mean, it&#x27;s a business enterprise, right? This is in the Middle Ages. European monarchs were taking it as a matter of royal prerogative to start standardizing weights and measures so that they could levy taxes. So, if they&#x27;re collecting like 6 bushels of wheat, it&#x27;s the same 6 bushels each time, for example. Thing that this word might have been derived from the idea of the king having a standard bearer. Somebody who would come around with like their staff thing, with like a picture of a lion or something.</p><p>And so, at this point we kind of can think of a standard as being the concept used to validate identification and transactions so that the transactions are the same. And the person is\u00a0who they say they are. That concept of standards specifying, verifying and validating sticks around for a really, really long time. But it doesn&#x27;t evolve very much until we get to the Industrial Revolution in the 1800s. That&#x27;s when other applications of the concept of a standard really start to become apparent. Because we get a lot of companies that are producing new goods and services. And they&#x27;re mass producing goods. They&#x27;re inventing new industries and markets.</p><p>And so, cutting a very long story short, with all of this proliferation of new products and things, the idea of the standard starts to include common infrastructure like rail systems and cable systems for communication. And also, the idea of that being a shared platform on which lots of people are going to send and receive things. Also, during the Industrial Revolution, we have the problem of a lot of mismatched infrastructure systems. And all of this explosion of new products begins to create a lot of chaos. Especially in our growing cities. So, you may have read books about this in college like Upton Sinclair&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle.&quot; And the growth is causing a lot of problems for our society. We had incompatible products, absolutely no oversight, what&#x27;s that? And so objective safety checks. Again, that&#x27;s where we had lots of loss of life from fires and like I mentioned, the jungle is a great example.</p><p>So, it became a government and a business imperative to fix these issues and fix these systems. But we all know that they did, and it was fine. No. They didn&#x27;t solve it. Who did it? Who stepped up? It was the engineers. Engineers started to collaborate with each other and form these professional organizations. Some of which are still around today. Like the ITU and IEEE, for example. These organizations provided a place where technical decisions could be vetted, debated, and then implemented. And to get all of that work done, what they did was host thing like technical Congresses which are kind of like the precursor to like TPAC today. They did debates, letter writing campaigns. They even had like meetups. They call them salons. But meetups, you know. I&#x27;m going to start calling my meetups salons. It&#x27;ll be cooler. And remember, they were doing all of this in the 1860s. That&#x27;s crazy to me.</p><p>So, the idea of a standard now includes, in addition to that currency and the validation, ideas about agreement and how we&#x27;re making agreement. In addition to ideas about interoperability and IP and patent concerns. Because these are all folks from different companies that are collaborating. 150 years later, we are still using the same organizational structures and methods for standardization. And we&#x27;re standardizing a lot more stuff. There&#x27;s a standard for practically everything. Especially if it relates to safety or operations or something. There&#x27;s a standard for the fabric on these chairs. On your office chairs at home. Like, everything, if you can think of it, there&#x27;s probably a standard for it. And why do we need them? Why specifically might we need web technology standards? Because, you know, hopefully you infer from the little quick history bit, they have pretty significant social and political, technical and economic implications for society and how we work. JavaScript, and other web technologies, have to be able to meet some pretty important and explicit needs.</p><p>That standardization process that these guys invented so many hundreds of years ago at this point ensures that the technologies end up addressing those needs and provides some benefits as a result. So, let&#x27;s take a look at three examples of those.</p><p>Government procurement is one. Say that\u00a0a little bit - like it or not governments are pretty key buying segments in nearly every industry and in nearly every country. The unique nature and role of government means that they have a huge impact on how a lot of products and services are made. And software is absolutely not an exception. And so, they do that in a couple of key ways. One, of course, is purchasing ICT products and services. The standardization process actually generates specification docs and references and that kind of thing that demonstrate conformance to a given government&#x27;s request for proposal, RFP. They have to be able to demonstrate that the technology is going to conform to that in order to, you know, be used by the government.</p><p>Second, is support and compliance. So, spec language can also make it quite a bit easier to ascertain whether if a technology is going to be in compliance with a government RFP. And SDOs, standards developing organizations, will often partner with training companies or offer it themselves to certify technologies or vendors or products so that they can, you know, they can say that they&#x27;re compliant with the technology. As a fun fact, I actually used to work for a company that printed ISO9000 training materials way back in the day in college. I was like, what is this? Is this ever gonna be used? Yes, everyone uses that. Wrong, Jory. And then they publish their specs because government has a majority impact on competition. SDOs publish because they want people to implement and support them. The more implementations, the more successful the spec. And that means more adopters, that means more vendors and that means more possible service providers and no lock in. And we certainly don&#x27;t like vendor lock in.</p><p>Second example. Market development. So, standards minimize the risk and costs associated with new technologies. Which can, of course, create or enlarge existing markets. And lead to fairer competition. One way they do that, or one way you could do that, of course, is through import/export regulations. You might want to enter a new geographic market. And here standards help facilitate trade between countries because they provide some common approaches and compliance assurances. So, we know that the standards that apply to the product in country A are in agreement, alignment, with the standards that might be required in country and B. Product interoperability. That&#x27;s basically what these concerns are about, right? Standards can help guarantee, in that they always do guarantee, but they can help guarantee a certain degree of interoperability. Or a minimum level of performance for products and services or processes and that sort of thing. And that is super key.</p><p>And then lastly, market creation. So, again, when we think about innovating new technologies that a standards process can help add credibility to the technology and help stabilize it and signal maturity that it&#x27;s ready to go into products. Last example: Public policy. This we&#x27;ve talked a little bit about this on stage today. In some cases, standards can inspire public policy and regulations. But in other cases, the policy ends up inspiring the standards making process. The distinction to remember between like standards and regulations is that conformity with standards is voluntary. But regulations are often compulsory. That&#x27;s why they&#x27;re regulations.</p><p>With that said, standards are often either fully or partially captured into regulations and made\u00a0 made into law because that simplifies and accelerates a lot of regulatory work. Thanks to the best practices that may have been defined in the standards process. So, we can look at standards and public policies like GDPR to see how technology and regulatory frameworks are emphasizing one another. How they&#x27;re relating with one another. We can also see how standards orgs like the W3C and Oasis, for example, take on standards work specifically to address public policy concerns in areas such as privacy and security. That&#x27;s a big one.</p><p>So, delivering on the needs of government procurement, on market development, on the needs of public policy, and, of course, reaping the benefits that we get from them is much easier said than done. And to do that, standards developing organizations have to meet certain requirements in order for those standards to be accepted by other governments, accepted by other markets, et cetera. And what those requirements are and ultimately will be depend on the level of standardization that&#x27;s actually required. And what kind of organization the group is. Because as we pointed out, there&#x27;s like a lot of them.</p><p>So, what kinds are there? There we go. So, we really look at two different kinds that we&#x27;re gonna interact with more as, you know, people in the industry. The first is national standards bodies. Which are usually\u00a0public in that they can be government sanctioned organizations. Or they could also be private organizations or a combination of them that issue country specific standards and so, you see a lot of these\u00a0and where these impact us most are like in Asia. Asian countries collaborate with the international and the regional standards development organizations and representatives of their countries to, you know, get a standard incorporated in services.</p><p>The second group is industry standards bodies. And those are the ones that, you know, I was talking about earlier with W3C and ITF. Those are primarily established by industry groups that want to coordinate their efforts on specific subjects. Or they may have been created by a national standards body in order to coordinate standardization efforts on particular subjects like security, for example. Or, in the indication of like IETF is another example, a gathering of independent professional who is promote best practices and standards innovation in specific areas. So, just to kind of reiterate the connection here, ANSI, the American National Standards Institute is the USA&#x27;s national standards body. But it&#x27;s actually comprised of members from these industry groups of which I think W3C belongs.</p><p>But I know Oasis and ECMA is an industry group that reports to the Swiss national standards body. That&#x27;s not confusing at all. If than industry body wants its standard to be accepted by a national body, so, become a government standard it needs to meet the rules and regulations of that organization. And if it further wants that standard to become an international standard, which JavaScript and HTML currently are, they have to play the final bosses. And the time bosses are the international standards bodies ISO, IEC and ITU are the final ones. The big guys. They place, of course, the most stringent participation and membership requirements on the standards bodies that feed work into them. And that&#x27;s done through different processes such as the past submitter process. Or a category liaisonship which is also obscure and weird. But failing to meet the requirements of those processes will end up jeopardizing the work. Which may be intended to become an international standard.</p><p>And I don&#x27;t know about y&#x27;all, but I think it&#x27;s really, really important that our web technologies are and remain international standards. Because that makes them truly, truly accessible to everybody everywhere. To develop them, the standards orgs need to meet certain requirements. And they have processes and policies at their disposal such as governance, review process and IPR. Those are vary between organizations. But given what&#x27;s at stake, they generally need to be really robust, really resilient, verifiable, and definitely repeatable.</p><p>Governance is one such area where there are requirements that standards bodies have to ensure. And that means rules about how people can participate, who can participate. And that factors into the growing concerns that global policy makers have about the provenance of standards. Where did this work come from? And they&#x27;re concerned about the equitability of information. Is one company pushing a standard through for its outsized benefit? And how fair is the process in business\u00a0in promoting fair business competition? Click.</p><p>So, if the governance is the who and the how, IPR is the what. So, members who contribute work to an organization at some point have to make a commitment to license those contributions in some way. And our standards bodies have different policies here. And sometimes that can affect where our work ends up. Whether we take something into the W3C, for example, or to a different organization.</p><p>For an international standard, they definitely need to know the provenance of all the materials that went into a standard. They need to know what the terms of those materials\u00a0what terms they were contributed under, so we don&#x27;t accidentally expose people to costly litigation or like the risk of a submarine patent or something like that. And that allows the standards org to provide access to X standard under Y terms. We obviously prefer royalty free patent regimes in our community. Hard core prefer that. But there&#x27;s also a lot of standards in telecom that aren&#x27;t\u00a0under. And that&#x27;s critical to make sure that it&#x27;s very, very clear what the rules are because it affects the economic function of an area.</p><p>So, the last example that we have are review periods. SDOs often have calls\u00a0different kinds of calls for review depending on what stage the standards process is in. They might have a patent review period where members can go and say, okay. This doesn&#x27;t, I do agree to contribute our work under these terms. And I didn&#x27;t accidently put something, and I didn&#x27;t mean to, that kind of thing. You can have a member review period, which might be the time when a working group is considered done with their work, but they want the broader body of the organization to have a chance to take a look at it. They have public review periods. Which might make the spec available to the broader public or like a watchdog group or something like that to have a chance to weigh in.</p><p>The W3C has a horizontal review period and review process which looks at different issues like accessibility and internationalization. And people are able to, during this time, raise objections during the review period. And in most cases those objections have to be addressed before the spec can move forward in the process and finish its standardization process. It&#x27;s a lot of different things to bear in mind when you&#x27;re making a standard. And I think we really need them. We need the policies and we need the oversight in order to provide checks and balances as we go about making standards.</p><p>And more importantly to me, obviously, web standards. It all adds up to a pretty high degree of scrutiny which we&#x27;re putting on these processes. Which the staff, the governing bodies of the SDO are all responsible for overseeing but we are all responsible for the process. We own the process of web standards. It belongs to us. So, we need to be mindful of it. Standardization is pretty critical in helping us keep the downstream implications of how we&#x27;re making decisions part of our conversations. So, we can protect access to people so that everybody in the world is able to leverage our work and create new opportunities. This work doesn&#x27;t just affect us. It affects all industries. It affects everybody. It affects people everywhere. It&#x27;s critically, critically important.</p><p>So, I&#x27;m going to end today with a call to action for each of you to get involved with the process of standardization. You can join the W3C or ECMA or ITF, any group that&#x27;s doing work that&#x27;s interesting to you. Join it as a member or as an invited expert. If you are already a member, then respect the process. Don&#x27;t weaponize it. If you don&#x27;t agree with it, make it better. Because we own it. And it&#x27;s really old. It probably does need some updating, as I mentioned earlier. Look for ways to make it better. And help that way. And, of course, as always, mind the professional code of conduct in these groups. Please and thank you.</p>",

		"transcript": "<p>ALI: Awesome. I&#x27;m the difficult one that even my own computer because, demos.</p><p>So, I&#x27;m Ali, I&#x27;m a software engineering instructor. I teach other people how to code. Today I&#x27;m going to be talking about augmented reality in JavaScript. So, a little bit of what we&#x27;re gonna be talking about. So, we&#x27;re gonna talk about what augmented reality is. And then we&#x27;re going to play with a ton of different demos. After that, we will talk about the different types of augmented reality there are out there.</p><p>Look at some my code. I wrote Snapchat&#x27;s filters in 37 lines of JavaScript. Talk about that. And talk about the future, what augmented reality will look like in a couple of years. So, to define augmented reality, you&#x27;re taking the real world and then you&#x27;re adding something to it. You may have heard of virtual reality. That&#x27;s creating a new world in 3D.</p><p>I think augmented reality is really powerful because you can take the real world and then add something to it. And that&#x27;s really powerful. It can mean for any sense, but the one that you see most often for now is visual. So, you&#x27;ll have the real world and have some visual element added to it. So, I am talking about augmented reality not because it&#x27;s something I do in my day job every day, but because I like art and code. And I have a blog.</p><p>And so, one of my blog posts, about two years ago, was about how to build augmented reality apps in JavaScript. And it turns out that a lot of people thought that I would be interested in giving talks about it, which I am. But I am not somebody, again, who writes augmented reality apps all day. At that point I didn&#x27;t feel like I was an expert at it. That&#x27;s the reason I&#x27;m talking about it.</p><p>I was so intimidated by the this idea of augmented reality, I thought you would have to know all this math and wild code and then did more research and it turns out you can do it in JavaScript. It&#x27;s basically just DOM manipulation is my whole entire application. I think this is really, really cool. At the time I saw a lot of apps coming out using Python or C++ and they were command lines that you could run and filter off of that.</p><p>And that&#x27;s good, but you have to be a programmer to run those applications. You have to download them and have Python running. And if you have built something for the web, anyone can use it just by going to a URL. Mobile apps are cool, but again, you have to download something, and the development is a little bit higher barrier to entry. JavaScript makes development accessible and also makes them accessible.</p><p>That&#x27;s why I wanted it use it to build an augmented reality app. There are so many different applications for augmented reality already. Art, which is one that&#x27;s really interesting to me. And I think augmented reality is going to be a really huge forefront there. There is gaming as well. You may have seen something like Pokemon Go, we&#x27;ll talk about that a little bit.</p><p>And then businesses are starting to use it as well. So, it can be a pretty powerful thing for marketing or just trying out elements as well there. And then there&#x27;s also more too. So, we&#x27;ll talk about some that have. So, one of the most common questions that I get asked about augmented reality is, when will we use augmented reality every day? And I know for the average person in the audience, maybe you don&#x27;t use augmented reality every day.</p><p>But for a different demographic, mostly teenage and girls and young women, it is something that they&#x27;re using every day. And my demographic is. And so, I want to talk about that and how powerful it already is. There&#x27;s going to be even more of a future for it. But it&#x27;s already massive. So, let&#x27;s look at some demos. So, the first two are Snapchat and Instagram. Instagram is so culturally dominant right now. Not just the app itself, but the world around it.</p><p>Like, I go to events and they have Instagram installations so that you take pictures of it and market the event for them. It&#x27;s a huge piece of it. And also, people buying ads on Instagram. So, that one is absolutely massive. They have in the stories you can put on filters on your face there. And then Snapchat who they pretty much just knocked off to do it. So, Snapchat lets you take images and put them on your face and alter your appearance then.</p><p>Those are the original ones. The fun part of this talk is you get to see my face a lot. Which is super fun because I&#x27;m especially jet lagged. So, that&#x27;s fine. One that you may have seen on social media is Face App. What it does is takes your face and does some machine learning on it and spits it out in different ways. So, the one on the\u00a0that side, the woman one, is a tweaked version of my face. So, I don&#x27;t know what they changed about it. But they made it way prettier and it&#x27;s super impressive. And the other side is the male version of my face, apparently. I&#x27;m glad that didn&#x27;t turn out that way for me.</p><p>There&#x27;s also face tune, which is a visual editing software for your phone. And you can essentially take what people made careers off of, airbrushing people back in the day, and you can do it in a couple swipes. Which is really powerful, but also terrifying. You can try on makeup. So, Sephora&#x27;s website lets you try on all sorts of different makeup. I don&#x27;t own blue lipstick, but I was wearing some today. IKEA, you can take the app and look at what it will look like dimension wise in your own using this augmented reality application.</p><p>Tesla, they&#x27;re using augmented reality for manufacturing. They&#x27;re using it to test the cars before putting them out into the wild. They&#x27;re also experimenting for the dashboard on your computer. Trying to have different panels on there using augmented reality as well. This is one of my favorite AR applications from 2010. So, it was a while ago. Zach Lieberman is an incredible artist. And hopefully this will load. oh, no. Let me try this. Sorry. Looks like I got disconnected. Oh, no! There we go. Okay. Well, I guess that is not working. Sorry about that. So, also museums. Museums are doing really, really cool things with augmented reality.</p><p>So, both for extending the artwork in their museums, but also for displaying their content in different ways. For example, walking tours. It used to be that you had like headsets and would type in numbers at different pieces of art and they would tell you about it. Now, using augmented reality, you can walk to places and based on your location, you will hear information about the artwork. That&#x27;s incredible as well.</p><p>The Louvre also made it so that you could project their artwork no matter where you were in the world. So, in Los Angeles, they had a warehouse and converted it into the Louvre by doing projections there. That&#x27;s really cool as well. Pokemon Go, you may have played this. I didn&#x27;t really, but my mom was into it even though she didn&#x27;t know Pokemon. That was really fun. You could capture these little animals that were out in your world and that game was huge for a while. And there are other games like it as well now. Rock climbing.</p><p>Rock climbing is one of my big hobbies and people are using augmented reality to create climbing routes and climbing competitions which used to be static. You used to have a route setter and put tape up and that&#x27;s how it is now, but you can use augmented reality, allowing for quicker and dynamic route settings. That&#x27;s really cool as well. And then it even goes beyond that. They&#x27;re using augmented reality for medical purposes as well. In order to increase contrast for some people who have visual impairments.</p><p>So, you can see the different lighting that may help some people see certain settings better. So, it goes beyond this artistic and marketing world as well. So, there are a couple different types of augmented reality. The first one was marker based. So, marker based augmented reality was the very first type.</p><p>And you would have something that was almost like a QR code or this serial marker here and you would project something based on top of that. So, that was pretty limited at that time, but a lot of augmented reality is still based off of markers. So, something in reality that you&#x27;re adding something to. Usually your face. But there are other things as well that you may add augmented reality on top of. Markerless augmented reality is similar, but just no markers.</p><p>So, you&#x27;re adding something to the world without an item that you&#x27;re adding it on top of. So, something like Pokemon Go, something that&#x27;s location based would be markerless augmented reality. There&#x27;s projection based augmented reality. Something like that climbing route where you&#x27;re projecting something out into the real world using augmented reality. Superimposition based. You have something added.</p><p>This is a combination with marker and markerless. Something like IKEA, projecting the couches into the real world would be superimposition based. I want to talk about the ways that you can build augmented reality apps now. So, one way that you can is through something called A Frame. And ARjs on top of it. The really cool thing about it is that you can build augmented reality apps without using JavaScript. You can write HTML code and have augmented reality apps built out.</p><p>You have to use a marker, like the Hiro marker like I showed you before. It&#x27;s a little bit limited in that respect. Not as fancy as the face based augmented reality. But you can build something like that where it projects a cube on top of the Hiro marker and 10 lines of HTML is the only code you have to write. It&#x27;s pretty powerful.</p><p>And then I have been using tracing JS. So, tracking.js is a computer vision library for JavaScript. And what it allows you to do is detect things in the real world and then you can use the coordinates of the thing in the real world and build on top of it. So, I did face recognition. But they also have color based recognition or parts of your face or your hands or something along those lines. And it&#x27;s pretty lightweight. It&#x27;s in the massive, massive library by any means. And it&#x27;s super accessible. They have great documentation.</p><p>And it&#x27;s not impossible to write by any means. You don&#x27;t have to do a ton of the math yourself. And so, we&#x27;re gonna go ahead and look at my app in my code. So, I&#x27;m gonna switch over now. So, hopefully this works on stage and it&#x27;s giving me the flower, it&#x27;s doing that for anyone on the projection. I can switch it over to bunny ears as well. And it gets my face there. And this whole application was 47 lines of JavaScript.</p><p>So, I&#x27;ll show you that code now. So, starting off with the HTML, it&#x27;s pretty basic. The most difficult part of this whole project was actually stacking a Canvas on top of a video element that turned out to be a little bit tricky. But the fact that the CSS was the hardest part says a lot, I think. So, again, I have a video element which is how my video is taken from my webcam. And then I have a canvas on top of that. The canvas is where the actual filters are projected on top of. So, I have those two elements there.</p><p>And then my JavaScript. So, the at beginning, it&#x27;s just a bunch of grabbing things from the DOM that I&#x27;m going to be interacting with. And then I&#x27;m creating a new tracker for the faces on the screen. And then I&#x27;m grabbing the flower crown and the button. I&#x27;m taking the image. It&#x27;s gonna be an image object so that I have all the information about it. That&#x27;s going it store the crown itself and the bunny face as well.</p><p>And then you have the XY width and height. I have to scale those to fit better. I have ability to change pictures. And then I have the ability to change to the flower crown and the bunny ears as well. These coordinates here are just scaling for the images. I found two random PNGs on the Internet that were the flower crown and that bunny face. And so, I had to edit them a little bit in order to be the proper size.</p><p>And so, this is just scaling them. So, they&#x27;re X and Y coordinates and they&#x27;re width and height. By default, they fit on somebody&#x27;s head. This was the best for this because I was just tweaking that. But, again, not a huge amount of code here. And then some more tracking code. The first one is set initial scale.</p><p>This is how big the box around your face is. Behind the scenes tracking JS is making a box around where your face is. This is saying that the initial scale is going to be 4. If it&#x27;s 10 instead, then it&#x27;s a lot big and the crown goes way outside my head, that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s doing there. The step size is what it&#x27;s going to track to see the faces on the screen. This one is too, it checks for new faces pretty frequently on that video.</p><p>But you could speed it up, so it tracks faster. It&#x27;s a little bit less performant in that way. Or slow it down so it&#x27;s only looking for faces every couple seconds. And the last one is how picky the model is. It&#x27;s behind the scenes. It&#x27;s a binary classifier and I will talk about the algorithm later. And this is picking how picky that model is.</p><p>Turned this town, less than .1, it&#x27;s going to get false positives and thinks that things that are not faces are faces. So, I built this code in my instructor&#x27;s lounge which has whiteboard walls. There were pictures on the walls everywhere. And at first before I set this edge density, it kept thinking that all the drawings behind me were faces. And they were not. Then if I make it way more picky, it won&#x27;t see my face in some lighting like this or backstage or something along those lines.</p><p>So, that&#x27;s just something to play with to decide how picky you want the model to be. I&#x27;m making it track the actual video element on that page. So, that&#x27;s how I set that up. And then here&#x27;s the actual tracking. So, it&#x27;s an event. Listens for the tracking event. When that happens, it&#x27;s going to clear my canvas that I already have there. I&#x27;m gonna make it blank. Then for every face that&#x27;s in that event data, it is going to draw an image on it.</p><p>So, that&#x27;s all that I had to do. Most of this isn&#x27;t even code that is related to tracking JS. And I have this fully working AR app. I think I reformatted it so it&#x27;s 51 lines of code. But it&#x27;s normally 47. I added the three comments. That&#x27;s why. I didn&#x27;t even code golf this. Anybody use Code Golf? So, code golf is when you write code that&#x27;s as few letters as possible to pass challenges. I have fun doing that. I didn&#x27;t do that, I have full variable names and multiple things online. I could have made it less than 47 lines of code if I really wanted to.</p><p>But not a huge amount of code for a pretty cool app. So, the algorithm. So, tracking JS uses the Viola Jones facial detection. Facial detection and\u00a0 facial detection is face, not space. And facial recognition is whose face is. This is a binary classifier, it\u0092s a face, this is not a face. What it looks for is people&#x27;s eye region are further back so it&#x27;s darker than the rest of your face. And the nose and forehead region, cheekbones, are brighter. It&#x27;s looking for that essentially.</p><p>It sums up the pixel values in any rectangle and uses that pixel value of dark and lightness in order it see if something is a face or not. And then\u00a0yeah. So, that&#x27;s the Viola Jones algorithm right there. It&#x27;s used by a lot of facial detection software. Not just tracking.js. So, that is tracking.js. And it has a lot of other classifiers as well.</p><p>It has ones for different colors. It has things for your eyes or your nose or something along those lines. If you wanted to make your filters even better. I tried to add the dog filter at some point. But that got too difficult and like the nose and eye gap was too hard to implement. So, definitely would recommend using those pickier models if you were trying to do even more complicated facial filters. There are also a lot of other libraries out there as well for doing this.</p><p>Other JavaScript libraries. And the reason I didn&#x27;t go with them is just because the documentation was worse. And so, that&#x27;s a vague call to action for open source maintainers to make sure that your documentation is good. But what comes next? I think augmented reality is going to be huge in the future for a lot of different purposes. I think that the artistic applications are really powerful. In Washington, D.C., where I used to live, there&#x27;s this art museum called the Art Tech House. And they&#x27;ve had tons of augmented reality exhibits there.</p><p>And so, definitely a lot going on in that world. And then, as far as the code goes, I think that it&#x27;s going to become more and more accessible. So, Mozilla is coming out with mixed reality APIs that are built straight into the browser. So, you don&#x27;t need to download another library or anything like that. You can build augmented reality and virtual reality apps straight with this browser API. In addition, there&#x27;s also the face detection API.</p><p>That one&#x27;s implemented in some versions of Chrome. And that detects whether something is a face or not already just in JavaScript. And just in the browser itself. So, again, you don&#x27;t have to download anything else. It&#x27;s really incredible how fast this is evolving and how much is already getting built into the browser. And it&#x27;s even gonna go further, I think, in mobile applications as well. The thing with websites is that you&#x27;re really limited by webcams and webcams aren&#x27;t necessarily the best harnesser of information in the world.</p><p>And so, there&#x27;s definitely going to be more with mobile apps than anything. In addition, the marketing context is going to be really interesting as well. Trying on clothes, trying furniture, all sorts of different things right into your browser.</p><p>So, that&#x27;s all\u00a0these are more resources as well. If you&#x27;re interested in reading up about any more of the heavy mass side or anything like that, I&#x27;ve got all of these linked. My slides are online, Ali Spittel\u00a0they will be up online as long as history is going. Unless I delete GitHub or something. They are online.</p><p>You can look through all these resources on getting started with augmented reality. There&#x27;s the Viola Jones paper based off of that mathematical algorithm that tracks. And my article on using tracking.js to make the Snapchat filters. Awesome command new bee, if you saw Saron doing the podcast, she has another. Zach Lieberman, my favorite augmented reality artist. I have his Instagram link there. And I have some of the libraries that you can use as well.</p><p>And keep in touch if you want to reach out. I will be at this event tonight and tomorrow as well. But you can also find me online if you want to talk more about augmented reality. And thank you all so much.</p>",

It&#x27;s wonderful. Great. Great folks here. And the transcription, amazing. It&#x27;s really great being here in this venue. It&#x27;s like been really inspiring, actually.</p><p>So, you know, I got here yesterday, and one thing I&#x27;m noticing is we&#x27;re having a lot of overlapping themes in my talks. I also will reference the Simpsons in a little bit. I have an anecdote about Mike Taylor. I know, just one. I can add another one, really, right? And, you know, like all of the other presenters, I love the web.</p><p>So, we mentioned I have been working in the open web since 1995. I saw my first web page in 1994 and I\u00a0for the life of me, I&#x27;ve never been able to find this page again. But it was some mixed media artists. It was really wild art. I was going to college. It totally blew my mind and kind of set in my head that the web is just this wild and creative place. It&#x27;s wonderful. And it&#x27;s also this place for business. Which is interesting. And a source of, you know, some of the issues that we have today. But it&#x27;s also a place where people from all over the world connect. It&#x27;s just really an incredible political and social experiment.</p><p>And the web enabled me to see this story. I don&#x27;t know if you all saw this. It has everything, though. There&#x27;s a crime. There&#x27;s a jailed bird. And there&#x27;s a stale piece of bread. And let me just zoom in a little bit for a moment. So, in case you missed the story, the bird is in jail because its owner was caught in a robbery and the police didn&#x27;t have a bird cage. Okay, we&#x27;ll just stick it in the cell, give it water and bread. Didn&#x27;t know where to put it. And I just want to bless the GDPR or the e privacy director or whatever for the image.</p><p>Diane Hosfelt is doing a conversation corner about VR and the privacy issues. I want to let you know that putting the bar across the eyes of a bird does not protect its privacy. You need to device the feather patterns, the perching pattern the size and the shape of the beak. It&#x27;s not going to protect it. If you want to protect a bird&#x27;s privacy, we can talk later.</p><p>So, in the words of Bruce Schneier, I&#x27;m a short term pessimist and a long term optimist. You feel incredibly lucky that I get to work on Firefox, you know? And the threats and problems that I&#x27;m gonna talk about today, they&#x27;re really faced by everyone. And many of the solutions that I&#x27;ll talk about are things that every browser does or could do. And some of the work that Mozilla does is uniquely us. And it springs from our mission.</p><p>So, the backdrop here is a web that is increasingly influenced by what is called big data and what people call psychographic driven marketing. There are some fundamental questions that we need to debate about this. And I&#x27;m just going to scratch the surface here. It&#x27;s a really huge topic. But what I&#x27;m hoping here is to, you know, convince you that browsers are uniquely situated to have like a very significant technical and policy impact on massive data collection. And\u00a0we all have a stake in what happens next.</p><p>So, before I can talk about the web and privacy, though, I feel like I should explain how I think about privacy. To me, privacy is how we form our sense of self. How we become individuals and form relationships. It&#x27;s how we, like, form critical thoughts and then decide whether or not we&#x27;re gonna share them. Sometimes, you know, we invent technology that helps with this as a manager. I spent a lot of time in meetings with people who are like all over the world. And we do that over video. And I&#x27;ve had a lifelong problem controlling my facial expression and reactions. So, face me, it&#x27;s an amazing invention. Yeah, we have technology that assists us in every aspect of our interaction on the web.</p><p>So, Mozilla&#x27;s founders believed that privacy was such an important concept that they, like, enshrined it in our manifesto. This is it. Individuals&#x27; security and privacy on the Internet are fundamental and must not be considered optional. This is the principle that guides much of the privacy work that I do. And balanced against the social and political realities that we face. We&#x27;re working on developing products that demonstrate our world view. But also make effective global policy change that puts people&#x27;s rights at the center. But policy, sorry, privacy\u00a0 is more than a personal right to choose.</p><p>In order to exercise privacy, we really need to be free from surveillance. There&#x27;s this great paper called \u201cWhat is Privacy For?\u201d by Julie E. Cohen. It&#x27;s available online. You can search for it. This was published in I think 2012. And she makes the argument that privacy is not just an individual right or simply the right to choose to be private, but that it&#x27;s a collective right. And it requires nuanced and sometimes unprincipled thinking in order to defend it.</p><p>So, she also describes the purpose of privacy in a way that I fundamentally agree with which is that privacy ensures that the development of subjectivity and the development of communal values don&#x27;t proceed in lockstep. This is the source of creative tension behind change in culture and really making a better world. And, you know, it&#x27;s, like, get very personal here. It&#x27;s quite personal to me as a child of, you know, a Chinese man and a white American woman. To me, like, without freedom of expression, freedom of privacy, freedom of thought, like I literally would not exist. And it&#x27;s that freedom also that allows Mozilla to exist in the world.</p><p>And one of the critical definitions that Julie Cohen shares is surveillance is attention that is purposeful, routine, systemic and focused. And the purpose of modern surveillance, and the purpose that I feel like I am fighting the most today is to reduce volatility and ensure sustainable profits. You know, government overreach is definitely a problem. But I believe that the existential threat we have today is these systems that nudge, try to smooth out profits and try to make people&#x27;s behavior more predictable. She call this is process modulation. Which is an extremely powerful tool to shape people&#x27;s behavior. And I watch this video of Alexander Nix from Cambridge Analytica, I don&#x27;t know if you all know who he is.</p><p>This German marketing conference invited him to speak and it was just an amazing thing. There was a panel that asked him if he was proud of himself at the end. It was great. He had an amazing answer. You should watch it. He repeated this claim that people are willingly as individuals choosing to share their personal information as inputs into the system that he runs. And, you know, I think he&#x27;s right to a point. But where he&#x27;s not right is that most people really do not understand the conclusions that are being drawn or the feedback loops that are being created based on their personal information.</p><p>And, you know, anyway, so, let&#x27;s have a look. What kind of things are pervasive surveillance used for? So, I&#x27;m an Instagram user. And you have a few friends, you know, kids who swap photos. You know, who have kids and we swap photos and whatever. And the system has decided that I really need a new pair of shoes. And so, I&#x27;ve seen the exact same pair of shoes like a hundred times. Just keeps showing me this hoping that I&#x27;ll buy. And guess what? One day I found myself on their website typing in my credit card. And, you know,, I have like a personal rule. Like, I&#x27;m not gonna buy shoes on the Internet. I&#x27;m going to try them on my feet before I buy them or whatever. But the repeated presentation of this to me got me. Got me to move. You know? Got me to do that. I didn&#x27;t end up buying them. But, you know, I was very close. Close call.</p><p>So, here&#x27;s another example of how the ad surveillance\u00a0is functioning. This is my Mike Taylor story. We all heard about creepy ads where people swear their device must have been listening to them. I was hanging out with Mike and his wife here, and he was driving, and they were talking about a place to eat. They were just chatting. Oh, I better get the address on my phone and map it. Pull up his map and what he found when he opened the map, the address was already there, the place was there, and a little bubble had been dropped on the place. Oh, that was weird. But this one is kind of similar.</p><p>So, this image was sent to me by my friend&#x27;s husband who had recently suffered a pretty serious injury to his hand. The next day he opens up Facebook and it shows this ad, which I don&#x27;t know if you can tell, it&#x27;s Homer with a hand injury. It&#x27;s like a poster that tells you to be more safe. And it&#x27;s for sale. So, like, I think what happened here because we don&#x27;t really know, right? Clearly some system in Facebook had determined that he had hurt his hand. And, you know, then somebody at Granger had bought some sort of an ad recently for people who have had hand injuries? I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s so weird. Anyway, so we ended up having this. Now that we&#x27;ve seen that, I had this thought and I asked some of my coworkers. And I said, do you think we could get even more specific?</p><p>Have any of you seen this? The Spinner. Yeah. There&#x27;s a few of you. You should totally check out this site. It&#x27;s pretty absurd and we&#x27;re pretty sure it&#x27;s a parody because the guy that runs the site, he&#x27;s given some pretty outrageous interviews to a bunch of mainstream news outlets. The idea is you can spend $49 and buy ad time to target someone specifically. One of the ideas on there is you want your family to be okay with you getting a puppy. So, you show them lots of like, you know, stories about great puppy stories</p><p>There&#x27;s another one that you want to influence your intended, your spouse to be to propose to you. And so, there&#x27;s that. So, there&#x27;s all sorts of things. And they start out pretty bad. But mostly innocent and quickly kind of get dark. So, you&#x27;ll see from some of the profiles that we know are generated, I&#x27;m going to show you in a few minutes, it&#x27;s just really not out of the question that we could figure out how to buy an ad and which parameters that we could use in order to ensure that we show them to a specific person. And, you know, as you get, you know, overlapping categories, you&#x27;re gonna get more and more specific about a person. And you could probably make sure that you show them an ad that you wanted them to see.</p><p>So, you know, all of those are kind of goofy examples and the Spinner one is probably not real world at this point. But really those particular things don&#x27;t really do harm to people. And I&#x27;m sure some of you may have a little more even extreme views on ad targeting than I do. But I wanted to make a moment to get out there a couple issues with this system that give me pause and are not so amusing, really, and kind of motivate my work.</p><p>So, looking back at those shoes. So, I&#x27;m a woman. And those shoes that I was seeing ads for was for women. It kind of makes sense they want to target women for women&#x27;s shoes. It&#x27;s harmless enough. But, you know, it turns out that this kind of audience segmentation can be used in ways that are actually quite harmful. So, this is a pretty obvious case of abuse of profiling. Facebook letting job advertisers only show advertisements to men. And they were calling out Uber. There&#x27;s a great organization called ProPublica that researches data abuse. They put this out last year. And they had an update in the last couple weeks, maybe in the last week. They learned that the equal opportunity employment commission, a regulatory commission in the US, investigated the claims made by ProPublica, and forcing Facebook to restrict job, housing and other ad buyers so they couldn&#x27;t use this audience segmentation in the future. It&#x27;s actually kind of a positive ending to that story.</p><p>Another reason why I really care about targeting, it has to do with this thing called profiles for reference. Here&#x27;s a list of the few possible profile categories that advertisers can use. There&#x27;s a link to the full list which is kind of disturbing if you look at all of it. Some of these are problematic listen. But in combination they can be particularly concerning. And these are conclusions drawn by algorithms about people and they&#x27;re turned into a very terse label for advertising. They can be eerily accurate about personal things. And some are being used for real time advertising, of course. And we can assume that all the advertisers, you know, have our best interests in mind and that they&#x27;re only showing us ads for things that are gonna help us with these problems. But we know that we are in an adversarial situation right now for people who are buying ads as well as their use of social media.</p><p>And these systems that people are buying ads, they don&#x27;t really try to get you to buy shoes anymore. They&#x27;re lying about who they are. They&#x27;re faking information. They&#x27;re trying to influence political views. And they&#x27;re influencing elections. So, stopping the data collection that leads to the generation of these profiles being useful is definitely part of the work of my team.</p><p>So, given all that, how is that Firefox helps any of this? So, I want to say, some of the things I&#x27;m gonna talk about, like I said earlier, they&#x27;re really things that are part of every browser or could be. And I think about this in the combination of ensuring like basic security, preventing surveillance, fighting surveillance, and finally establishing better default and educating people about what they are.</p><p>So, the first thing that we have to ensure is that we maintain security for users despite the fact that, you know, the browser is this place where we run untrusted code from people that we don&#x27;t know and we just kind of like hope for the best. Hope may be underselling it a little bit. But there&#x27;s like a ton of really great work that goes into this. And here&#x27;s just some big areas. This is just kind of like a high level selection of topics. There&#x27;s a lot more that goes into this. But, you know, thinking through like the basic security things that need to happen in a browser. We have to have OS level sandboxing. And this is to restrict access to APIs that could be used and abused. We need process level isolation of sites. This is specter and meltdown. And in Firefox, it&#x27;s vision. We fix a ton of security bugs and just bugs in general. And we use the safe browsing API which is something that Google maintains to prevent users from accidentally visiting malware and phishing sites. Phishing is one of the things that hurts regular users today.</p><p>We rewrite things in Rust. One thing that we&#x27;re implementing from scratch today is HTTP 3, it&#x27;s called quick. It&#x27;s just starting to be integrated now. And we&#x27;re really thinking about another thing I didn&#x27;t put it in the slides, but we&#x27;re thinking about WebAssembly as well as something that we can use not just to deliver applications, but actually in the browser maybe to sandbox third party applications. And honestly, like I said, there&#x27;s a lot more both in terms of standard developments, things like our collaboration with TOR. But most of the other browsers do many of these things or post of them. And at this point we all do that because we all take security quite seriously.</p><p>So, once we secure the browser, we have these privacy features that we implement. And those features don&#x27;t exist in a vacuum. They&#x27;re accompanied by policies, open processes and maybe even a community to support them. So, tracking protection. This is\u00a0 the original version of tracking protection has been in the browser for quite a long time. This is one of the ways that we fight surveillance in the browser. Safari has ITP, and Edge is talking about ITP as well. A local machine learning approach that we think is cool. Our approach is list based and doesn&#x27;t involve machine learning. So, what tracking protection does is in its most strict form, is it actually just doesn&#x27;t load the trackers. It blocks them at the network level. It&#x27;s in a component called NECO that it blocks them.</p><p>In the least form, it simply blocks the trackers from having read access to data about a website. And we may strip cookies for track theirs we find are evading our policies. Which has happened. And we operate this system, you know, by working with a third party, disconnect. And they create and maintain these lists. And they&#x27;ve established a criteria that you can see and read on their website and an accountability framework for dealing with, you know, incorrectly added sites and things like that.</p><p>So, this is one of those examples of us combining a technology with a transparent and accountable policy approach, you know, that underpins just about everything we do. So, another thing that my team works on is this thing called the certification authority root program and the common CA Database. This is run as an open forum, and it&#x27;s for Firefox for certificates. Program is considered the gold standard honestly for deliberative and open processes in this industry. And there are many organizations that just simply follow our lead or wholesale use our route list to secure HTTPS and whatever it is, open source project or whatever. And no other trust program is open like ours. It&#x27;s kind of amazing, actually. You get to see the people who administrate this program calling out CAs and telling them they screwed something up and people on the Internet piling on. On a mailing list. It&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s very cordial.</p><p>But our policies about trust and accountability and transparency, they underpin the security of HTTPS through this program. Another area of work that we do that I don&#x27;t know is as obvious is Internet protocol work. We have several people who are highly engaged with the ITF. And TLS\u00a01.3 and DNS over HTTPS or DoH are changes to the Internet that improve security. TLS\u00a01.3 really improved performance. And the changes from 1.2 to 1.3 made it significantly harder to intercept and control web traffic. There was a lot of pushback when it was being created. DNS over HTTPS, or DoH, is another Internet protocol. This one&#x27;s a little bit more controversial right now.</p><p>What it basically is it takes DNS requests and tunnels them through HTTPS. What&#x27;s interesting is if takes DNS which is traditionally a plaintext protocol and encrypts it. And it makes it by tunneling through HTTPS, makes it much more difficult to filter or eavesdrop on. So, Firefox approach to it is different than Chromes. We&#x27;ve decided to have a strong policy approach, limiting data to 24 hours and ensures transparency and accountability for blocking. Either censorship or could be some other kind of blocking.</p><p>But ensuring that there&#x27;s transparency to that so people know that things are being blocked. Because that&#x27;s not the case in a lot of places today. So, anyway. We&#x27;re taking this rollout quite slow. And, you know, initially it&#x27;s only gonna go to the US. But we&#x27;re working to find trusted resolver partners throughout the world right now. And our hope is honestly that this protocol is deployed everywhere because it&#x27;s going to significantly reduce surveillance throughout the world.</p><p>So, we&#x27;re also working on this thing called Firefox Private Network, which is supposed to be like a beta name. But, you know, we&#x27;ll see. It&#x27;ll probably have a name when it is actually fully released. Right now, it&#x27;s in testing phase. It&#x27;s free right now. But we probably are going to charge some nominal fee for if later for the operating costs of it. It&#x27;s currently structured as a secure proxy that just proxies everything in your browser to a third party. And our goal here is to provide protection to users by hiding their IP address from trackers. Providing this is part of a layered approach to security. Where we&#x27;re enabling tracking protection by default, continuing to implement other privacy enhancing features that reduce surveillance and helping people hide their IP address while they browse. Which, you know, the IP addresses are a significant source of unique identification for users. Because honestly most people&#x27;s IP address, particularly in their homes, they don&#x27;t change over time.</p><p>So, the last bit of anti surveillance work that we do is to educate people about it in the product as well as with like publications and papers and things like that. But I&#x27;m just gonna show three things. I already kind of did this massive laundry list of tech. But I realize when I was preparing for this talk, like we probably need like a central place where we would list these things. So, I&#x27;m gonna take that upon myself to do that when I get back home, you know, after the conference, though.</p><p>So, here&#x27;s just three things that came to mind. One new thing that you&#x27;ll see in Nightly in beta today is our protection report. This shows you how many trackers have been blocked by our system. And provides links to additional information. This is more for like just, you know, regular people that are using the browser and they&#x27;re curious about what is happen with tracking protection. Anyway, we&#x27;re adding more support to this tool over time and it will, you know, include support for services that we operate.</p><p>Something that the Mozilla Foundation works on is called the Internet health report. They pick different topics each year, but surveillance was a big part of the 2019 report. These are short pieces that are collections of like primary sources to give people like a fast way and like a summary. Give people like a fast way to get an understanding of a topic. I think it&#x27;s actually pretty valuable, you know, to get people to understand these big, complex things that take a lot of time to research if you don&#x27;t really have a guide and do it.</p><p>I also wanted to share Firefox Monitor. This is a service based on have I been PONED yet&#x27;s database, the greatest name for business ever. It alerts you if your email address has been hacked and compromised through a website breach. When websites get breached, often the breached data gets posted somewhere. So, you know, this particular service goes around looking for that. And then if they find it, they let you know. The purpose is to help people with a very common problem which is, okay, I have been breached. What do I do?\u00a0and sometimes you don&#x27;t get informed in a timely manner on these breaches. We&#x27;ve occasionally gotten information before people were informed by the company.</p><p>So, anyway, we support multiple contacts, sorry, email accounts to be monitored in a single Firefox account and send out alerts when new breaches happen. We have hit about 4 million subscribers in the service and it&#x27;s one of the more popular things we have. I put a note in that we&#x27;re close to the end. So, just a few more slides and I just wanted to say, privacy is really essential to being human. It&#x27;s how we grow and change and make the world a better place.</p><p>And the web is part of our world. So, I really believe that privacy is essential for being a human on the web. But what we know is that the web really wasn&#x27;t designed with privacy in mind. It really wasn&#x27;t designed with surveillance in mind. It really once designed to give out the threat model at all, really, and those threat models have evolved and we&#x27;re still trying to catch up. And I really think that we now need to disrupt this system that&#x27;s emerged. And we need to protect everyone. Not just ourselves, you know? But, you know, well we do need to protect ourselves. Protect myself, from buying extra pairs of shoes that we don&#x27;t need. We need to protect people from being discriminated against for jobs or housing. And, you know, I also think we need to protect people from having our essential selves being labeled and nudged in these scary and even dangerous ways with these feedback loops in advertising systems.</p><p>So, what can we do? What can we do to help preserve privacy? Well, I really believe that browsers provide this very understandable way to like very understandable privacy properties to people. And we can fight surveillance right in the browser and have a sustainable future for the web. It&#x27;s what I believe, anyway. Firefox does a lot here on a tech and policy basis. And other browsers do a lot too, but I really think we could all do more. And we can do more through encryption. In the protocol level, there&#x27;s lots more to do there. Like there&#x27;s a standard called ENSI that I hope that we get through as well that would encrypt the last kind of bit of unencrypted DNS information. We can all do this through policies in the browser standards and also by blocking harmful tracking and enabling user choice.</p><p>So, I believe that every person or company also can take action to reduce the amount of data that we collect. So, Mozilla has a site that describes our lean data practices. Our data stewardship practices. And we welcome everyone. If you scroll down to the bottom, there&#x27;s a link, click to contact us. Talk to us about lean data. We love to have those conversations and we have people who give talks to organizations about this.</p><p>And what about our future? Right? The one that Henri shared yesterday, you know, of this ever expanding world and phones everywhere. Some of them feature phones, but some of them phones with apps. We&#x27;re gonna have these phones with apps. What are we gonna do about those? Well, we know that apps are invading people&#x27;s privacy basically without restraint at this point. And unlike the browser, there&#x27;s only these like monopoly like app stores that are controlling the policies and the gatekeepers for this. You know, they&#x27;re the ones that are reviewing these apps and checking for violation. And we don&#x27;t really have a set of policies that make sense right now, I think.</p><p>We&#x27;re really in this Wild West stage and I think it&#x27;s going to get worse before it gets better. I just\u00a0 I want to close with this. Uninstall your apps.</p><p>Yeah. You&#x27;re probably not going to uninstall all of them, but just uninstall one. This is my second Mike Taylor. Anecdote. I was talking to him about this and he was like, oh, man, after you talked to me, I uninstalled a couple apps. Yeah. So, yes, Mike has my back. So, yeah, just, you know, we don&#x27;t have to accept ubiquitous surveillance and mass data collection as inevitable like we can&#x27;t stop it. And even the little bits that we do to stop it do help. It disrupts it. And I think the way you got to think about this is what kind of a future do you want? We are right now on a path to a modulated one, you know?</p><p>It&#x27;s gonna be modulated by ad tech and profiling. It&#x27;s already happening. It&#x27;s happening today. And so, I&#x27;m asking you, uninstall those apps. Use the browser, especially in the mobile web. Support PWAs and alternatives. I know I&#x27;m preaching to the choir here on that. But I think it&#x27;s important to say to a lot of different audiences. Of course, I would love for you to pick Firefox, but really, I know. Just choose the web. It&#x27;s really worth your time to think about what happens in this ecosystem. And I&#x27;ll just say, you know, we&#x27;re hiring. You can join us in this fight. So, yeah, thank you very much.</p>",

		"transcript": "<p>Hey. All right. There are two names on this slide. And it&#x27;s because Yohan, who is not here, actually helped me a lot to create the slides. Especially the Indonesian part. I want to acknowledge his help on this presentation. I&#x27;m Kenji. I&#x27;m a product manager. I work on Chrome. Mostly on making things load faster or reliably, as it&#x27;s being said. And so, I want to talk to you about out web looks like in different countries. I&#x27;m not going to talk about the whole world because that won&#x27;t fit into 30 minutes.</p><p>But I&#x27;m just going to focus on some countries. But I want to share a little background about myself. As you may have noticed, I actually have a Japanese name. And maybe as you can tell, I have a French accent. It&#x27;s just because my father likes Japan, and so, decided to pick a Japanese name. His plan was, if I name my son with a Japanese name, he&#x27;s probably going to take an interest in the country and make his life in Japan so I can come more often to this country. And it actually just worked out this way.</p><p>Because I went to Japan the first time in around 2000. I did a bunch of university research. And then I eventually joined Sharp Electronics. I was in the midst of this very interesting time in Japan where there was a lot of innovation about feature form, very fancy things. Like iMode today. Like pushing the limit of what you can do on a very low spec device. And it just kept on and on and on. And you can see at the top, there is some kind of smart watch. And so, I feel that I&#x27;ve seen the future in some sense.</p><p>It was a bit geeky and whatever. But there&#x27;s this famous quote that Steve Jobs actually used, which is, he also said that good artists copy, and great artists steal. You look at something that is happening, and you make it your own. You refine your idea. And I think this is what happened eventually around the world. A lot of the innovation that you see here are things that we are still experiencing today and like we find better ways. And so, my hope is that by having you look at what&#x27;s happening around the world, you might pick up on some interesting like innovation that you wouldn&#x27;t have thought about in other ways. And so, we&#x27;ll see how that goes.</p><p>So, the plan is to talk about mostly three countries. India, Indonesia and Japan. And in 30 minutes! And that&#x27;s going to be very tough. It&#x27;s probably going to be very wide and shallow. And hopefully that helps you, like, piques some interest on the topic and want to explore more and maybe want to talk with me afterwards. Right. Let&#x27;s talk about different opportunities that we have.</p><p>So, this is Indonesia. A lot of people as you can see on the picture. In terms of people who have access to the Internet, what I did is I looked at the number of subscribers, broadband subscribers around two things. Fixed connection at home, typically, and mobile connection. So, the first thing you notice is that this market is very much a mobile market. A lot of users just keep the fixed connection and go for the mobile device and mobile connection. It&#x27;s only 32% penetration in terms of the Internet users compared to the population. But it&#x27;s already number seven in terms of number of users who have access to the Internet. And population wise, it&#x27;s the fourth most populated country in the world. There&#x27;s a lot of potential for growth. It&#x27;s going to be very interesting how that goes. It&#x27;s a very interesting market.</p><p>This is Japan. And this is quite different. Because Japan has been connected for a long time and they have a lot of users using laptops and things like that. In terms of penetration, it&#x27;s very high. It&#x27;s 91%. It&#x27;s the number five country in terms of number of people who have access to the net. And in terms of population, it&#x27;s only 11. And it&#x27;s going to decline, as you know. But it&#x27;s still a very interesting market driven, trying to drive innovation and things like that.</p><p>And finally, India. So, this one is similar to Indonesia in the sense that it is very much a mobile market. Half a billion users using the Internet through their mobile device. In fact, the whole buying a laptop is not something that people do. They would prefer to buy a mobile device. And we see why that is the case. It&#x27;s also still like very much like just the beginning. It&#x27;s only 34% of penetration. It&#x27;s already number two in terms of the number of users after China. And population wise, it&#x27;s the number two country, right? So, a very interesting market.</p><p>All right. So, we do have a lot of users. How about like their ability to access the Internet? And first and foremost, like the quality of the mobile connection. And so, it&#x27;s kind of like asking ourselves, is the mobile connection gangster or not?</p><p>All right. So, this is the cost of data in 2016 for different countries. So, it doesn&#x27;t really tell you much. Like, is it expensive or not? How does that compare to what people are familiar with? And so, one thing you can do is look in terms of like power purchase parity. And so, it&#x27;s this idea of trying to find, okay, what&#x27;s the value of this particular currency in a different country? And so, that gives you an idea of how expensive that is.</p><p>The thing it doesn&#x27;t say is, if you look at this, it&#x27;s kind of roughly in the same ballpark. Maybe it&#x27;s cheap enough in 2016. But the fact is, this is actually very expensive. And the way to find out about that is to compare to how much percentage of the gross national income per capita. Which gives you a rough idea of the average income that people have over there. And at the time on a yearly basis, it&#x27;s about 3 to 2% for these two countries. Whereas in the US and France, it&#x27;s like 1/10th of that, right? Not only the income people have is, like, lower, but it said a higher fraction of the income. That is very expensive, right?</p><p>And then in September of 2016, there was a new announcement. There was a new carrier in Indonesia, Jio. The chairman was going to fix this. This is not acceptable. He announced a very aggressive plan. He said people that signed up within a set period of time, and also have a welcome pack. If you signed up within the three next months, you would have unlimited access to all of their geo services. But also 4 gigabytes a day for free for three months. That is game changing, right? And let&#x27;s look at what happened after that in terms of pricing today.</p><p>Today roughly 2018 2019, the price of 1 gigabyte is only 0.15% of the GNI. And it&#x27;s the cheapest mobile plan that you can have worldwide. So, it is very much affordable. It might not be affordable for everyone yet, it&#x27;s still on average. But it&#x27;s really affordable for most people that we talked to when we went there. Indonesia is similar. It&#x27;s slightly higher. But it&#x27;s still affordable for most people.</p><p>All right. So, affordability is good. But what about the speed? The number one country per the research in May is Korea. With 52.4 megabytes\u00a0per second. And just picked up this one, Netherland is actually doing pretty well. It&#x27;s number five. Japan, you would think it&#x27;s one of the countries where everything is super fast. It&#x27;s not that fast compared to Korea, it&#x27;s number 10. And sadly, okay, for Indonesia and India, it&#x27;s actually a bit like at the bottom of the pile. It&#x27;s only 7 megabit per second. And so, when we go there, they know it&#x27;s like marketed as 4G. But tend to think it&#x27;s like 4G, but it&#x27;s actually like 3G most of the time.</p><p>All right. And we also see that in the Chrome UX repo that we have. This is the effective mobile connection for different countries. And so, you can see that the effective 4G is only half of the time true. Most of the time it&#x27;s 3G. And it would be worse. Indonesia is similar. France is still\u00a0 there&#x27;s still room to improve things. Japanese, and Netherland is like, I don&#x27;t know if there is a country that does better than that. They&#x27;re killing it.</p><p>All right. The other thing that&#x27;s important to note is that there are a lot of users, as I said before. And so, depending on the time of the day, the speed of the connection is going to change a lot. It might be too congested. If you want to download a whole bunch of things, you have to wake up very early in the morning. Otherwise you are going to have a bad time during your commute and whatnot. And so, when we looked at this, we found out having an API where you can fetch content ahead of time based on your engagement with the website could be interesting so that you can offset data usage when it&#x27;s fast and whatnot.</p><p>Like data also you would think that even in Japan it&#x27;s an issue. But this is very interesting. This shows that for every month, it shows something like you can see there is an interesting pattern. And it&#x27;s the number of page loads per user on the device capable of 4G. And you can see that as the months go by, in number goes down, right? And you might wonder why that is the case. And this next graph kind of like explains what&#x27;s going on.</p><p>This is the page load time for devices capable of 4G in Japan. And you can see that as the month goes by, it keeps increasing and then it goes back down. And what&#x27;s happening is that most users actually have a very like unlimited plan. Most of them have like 3 gigabytes, right? And after that you can still use the net, but it&#x27;s going to be very slow. And so, people just don&#x27;t bother anymore.</p><p>Like, me personally, I have a 6 gigabyte plan. And I have been in that situation where at the end of the month was throttled. And I didn&#x27;t feel like using the web at all anymore. And this morning I checked how many gigabyte I used. I&#x27;m about 5 gigabyte on my mobile plan. And about 50 gigabyte on WiFi. And you can imagine for people who don&#x27;t have a laptop and only use their mobile device, like the data quota is super important.</p><p>The other thing that goes on in some countries like India is that sometimes the Internet is being shut down for various reasons. It could be to limit access to like chat apps to avoid having people like go together and things like that. And there are places in India where the Internet has been down for months. So, that&#x27;s also something you need to be aware of. Sometimes the connection is not available just because the Internet is, like, off.</p><p>Okay. I said maybe we should do a quiz about the next thing. And so, let&#x27;s see how that goes.</p><p>[Jeopardy music]</p><p>This graph shows the user interest spreading rapidly, but only in specific markets, right? It&#x27;s an app. It has 1 billion users, maybe even more than that if you believe all the stats that are available. Something is carrying. It works offline. And in fact, that is the whole point that have app. And you know what that is? No? No one? It&#x27;s a tough one. Okay. It&#x27;s an app called SHAREit. And the whole point of that app is to share files offline with your nearby friend. It&#x27;s very popular in India and other countries like that where the connection is maybe not always available. Back in the days it was too expensive to use it.</p><p>And so, if you had video of the famous artist, you would just share it through that app with your friend. And actually, I saw this come up in my feed week. Opera Mini is now shipping with an offline sharing feature for nearby friends. It is very trendy. When we work on web package, we could enable the use case like that. If you have the app, you have it in the package, you could share it with your friend nearby. We are excited by that. Also, it can speed up loading because if you have all the resources you need to have something like ready to go on your device, then you don&#x27;t need to care too much about the connection anymore. You can have a very interesting discovery experience where you have a feed of interesting apps or content that are ready to go. And you can even make things enticing. You can have a game that shows the game play loop. And then when you click on it, it launches instantly and seamlessly. I&#x27;m excited about that with web packaging and all the APIs like that.</p><p>Okay. Let&#x27;s talk about the device landscape. So, we actually went to India. Yet to go to Indonesia. I&#x27;m planning to do that after in November. And so, what we did is we went shopping for like devices to get a feel of what&#x27;s available. And we quickly realized that there were a lot of brands that we had no idea about. Like, for instance, this device is made by Oppo. Which I think is a Chinese brand from a different OEM. And so, some very interesting things happening there.</p><p>And then the other one is feature phones. Very popular in markets like India. I think there are about 100 million devices like that sold across the whole world. There is 1.5 billion feature phones still in use today. So, there is still a lot of potential for these feature phone devices that actually like are pretty close to being as good as a smartphone in terms what you can do on it. They have apps. The iOS is built on web tech. That is very exciting to see.</p><p>So, in terms of the device landscape, it&#x27;s essentially a lot of Android devices and iOS devices. In terms of the device you can see, it&#x27;s mostly at the low end of the spectrum. So, for instance, this one is the most popular smartphone you can see in India. It&#x27;s a model that only has 17 gigabyte of RAM. There is an update in 2018 with I think 3 or 4 gigabyte. Storage wise, it&#x27;s very limited. It only has 8 gigabyte. And, yeah. It kind of lags behind in terms of what version of Android is supported. Ka iOS devices, there are 70 90 million of those in India. It&#x27;s a very low end device. It only has 1/2 of a gig. But it is mostly free. Like if you sign up with Jio, you would get this device for free as long as you are willing to pay a tiny fee for the mobile plan for a couple of years.</p><p>The other thing we noticed is that because the storage is very small, all those devices come with a micro SD card. And you can buy a micro\u00a0SD card, and some are preloaded with content. This one has the YouTube Go app. Not only the app, it also has interesting content. That was interesting to see. Other things that people do when you buy a device, the clerk might load up your device with apps on the side. So, that was interesting and a bit scary, to be honest.</p><p>Okay. And then on my way back home I bought the latest like low end devices. And so, this J2 version, 2018, and a J6 + from Samsung. And it&#x27;s like 2 gigabyte of RAM, a bit more storage. Is a snapdragon 425. And same thing roughly for the J6+ with more RAM and more storage, but same CPU. And the price is very affordable.</p><p>And then the question is, okay, do these low end devices that constitute the bulk of what people use in the market, are they gangster or not? All right. So, this is like your benchmark of like the different CPUs that are available today on different devices. So, you have the very end, like iOS devices, top end of Galaxy devices. And you can see that every year like things are getting higher and higher for these ones. But then if you look at the budget one, there are a lot of gaps, right? And then at the very low end, the green one, there&#x27;s this Nokia II device which is like just roughly in the ballpark of like 2014. It&#x27;s like five years ago. And then the two devices I bought, those ones actually have way, way, way, way down there. Right?</p><p>So, like gigabyte of RAM is one thing. But the CPU you get on these lower end devices is very limited. And it&#x27;s not that they want to hit a target point. They are going to find ways to make that happen. And particularly, they would cut down on the things that people don&#x27;t necessarily understand. But the device is not gangster. But at least it gives the opportunity for users to access the web. So, that&#x27;s good about it. And it&#x27;s all a job to make sure that the experience that we create can scale through the whole gamut of devices.</p><p>All right. Indonesia is roughly similar. It&#x27;s a lot of sub $200 devices. So, same picture. The other thing we did is we talked to a different user. Especially user where like considering buying a smartphone or already had a low end smartphone to try to understand what is the motivation and things like that. So, a couple of things we learned.</p><p>First of all is that they don&#x27;t have the same background that we do. Like, I don&#x27;t know about you, but I&#x27;ve grown up with the Internet, right? I was using the Internet on my, like, beige IBM machine, right? And so, I know what the web is. What it is for. Whereas these users, for most of them, it&#x27;s the first time that they come online and so, they have no expectations whatsoever about the web. They buy the device. And whatever is on the screen is what they&#x27;re going to try first. And so, they hear from their friends about apps like WhatsApp and things like that. So, it&#x27;s good to know that they don&#x27;t understand things like tab and all of that, URL, none of that makes sense.</p><p>The motivating factor for most of these users were things like they wanted to keep in touch with their family and friends or their kids as they go study in different cities, for instance. The other thing was a desire to learn. And so, having access to information. The school also is investing in websites and things like that. All of that were the primary motivating factors.</p><p>The other thing that goes on is most of these users can afford to buy one device and that device gets shared for the whole family. So, that&#x27;s also important to note. As I said, like storage is a big concern. It&#x27;s very limited. And so, people do micromanage everything. And so, when we talk to partners, developers and so on, their main concern is to reduce the amount of storage that their app used so that they stay below the radar and don&#x27;t get evicted, right? So, that&#x27;s a big concern for developers over there.</p><p>The last one is in terms of use cases, it&#x27;s really about being more independent. Trying to improve your livelihood. Helping your kids, like, grow and learn and have the best option available for them to have a better future. So, these were the main things. In terms of like discovery, they were using search, YouTube. There is a real appetite for videos, for literacy reasons. I think the literacy rate in India is about 74%. So, there&#x27;s that. And there is also a lot of like language issues. A lot of content available in English is not really accessible for users over there. When we talked to partners, they wanted to double down on content that is written in a language that people over there can understand. And India has a lot of different languages.</p><p>That&#x27;s the other one is the language, reading, input, is very hard for most users. Okay, let&#x27;s look at how the web is used over there. So, there are many ways we could look at it. But I felt it interesting to look at that this thing that Yohan, see what people use in the countries. The websites that everyone uses across the whole world.</p><p>So, if you look at Indonesia, you can see that the local origin, the set of sites that are only used within Indonesia, is much higher than the set of websites that people tend to use across the whole world. So, that is indicative of a very vibrant ecosystem of developers over there. Like build things for the local users. So, that&#x27;s really good to see.</p><p>India is kind of interesting because you would expect\u00a0 expect a similar picture. But it&#x27;s still roughly half and half. And the reason for that is that for a long time the devices and mobile plan, all of that was not really affordable. And so, the audience was kind of like the elite. People who can read and speak English. That&#x27;s what you&#x27;re seeing here. But the partners we talked to really want to\u00a0 they feel like the market is already tapped out. So, they want to move on for local languages and trying to improve the local situation.</p><p>And at the extreme, I think this should look something like this. This is Japan. It&#x27;s roughly only like local stuff, right? And for good reasons, right? The Japanese language is very specific, right? It doesn&#x27;t look anything like English, right? And so, this is a preference for things that are built for the local language and for the local needs.</p><p>All right. And you can see that Japan like totally kills it in terms of like number of local websites. India is still like it&#x27;s pretty high. But I would expect to surpass Japan at some point. And Indonesia would be roughly in between, I might say. All right.</p><p>Now, if we look at what kind of tech is being used over there, is there anything specific to those markets that doesn&#x27;t exist here? Those kind of questions. And if we just look at the mobile local regime, it will give us an idea of what is being used. I think this was mentioned yesterday. Henri mentioned is that jQuery is the number one most popular framework. It is true for all markets. You have like in blue Indonesia, sorry, India. In red, Indonesia. Yellow is Japan. And then green is US. So, you can see jQuery, migrate, WordPress, jQuery UI, Modernizr, Microsoft ASP.NET. And React and not quite there. And a bunch of things like animate.css, Lightbox. So, with all that, is the user experience going to be good or not?</p><p>One way to look at it is Lighthouse. As mentioned yesterday, the major Lighthouse scores are around 41. And you can see that Japan and India and Indonesia are doing better than the median score. And unlike a country like Australia, like, they are doing pretty well on that basis. The downside of Lighthouse is that it is a lab measurement. And so, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily reflect the situation in the countries that people experience those websites.</p><p>Okay. And so, if we look at the actual user data from Chrome UX metrics, this is just showing the first contentful paint for different countries. You can see that the picture looks very different, right? On the previous slide, like, Indonesia was actually much faster than Japan, for instance. But in reality, it&#x27;s not the case, right? The opposite is true.</p><p>And the same for India. And essentially this is because of a combination of low end devices and also a connection that is not always fast or sometimes not available. And so, that does explain a lot of those issues.</p><p>So, in short,we got a lot of things to make go gangster. And so, we have a lot of work to do. Especially on finding ways to avoid being too reliant on a network connection. Like, I think it&#x27;s a bad to wait until the last minute to load something. I think like loading ahead of time to things like web packaging and all that have not only can improve discovery, but also the reliability of the user experience. And those things not only make sense for markets like those, but if you think about it, markets like Japan, US, and all of that, there are many reasons why an instantly available experience is something that people have come to expect based on the kind of experience that they have through native apps.</p><p>And so, there are a set of things we can do that will improve the user experience for users over there that will also help our users in more common markets. And there is still a lot more things to learn. It would be interesting to see what kind of innovation those countries come up with. Because they have very unique challenges. I didn&#x27;t mention it in the talk, but like in terms of like payments, a lot of users over there don&#x27;t have a bank account. And so, there is this question of, okay, how do I pay for goods on an eCommerce website?</p><p>And so, for a long time, people were paying when they were receiving the goods. The goods would be delivered to them and it would pay on delivery. Which is something maybe people did back in the days, but not so much anymore. So, there is a whole set of things that could be done better for these markets as well. In Japan, interestingly enough, there is a resurgence of payments through QR code. Which was a thing back in the days. Didn&#x27;t work out. It would be interesting\u00a0to see why this time around it will change.</p><p>All right. I use this picture which I took in India because I felt it was interesting to see that someone had a website looking email address. But actually, thinking about it like what I did is essentially, right, like this idea of let&#x27;s do a quick overview of different markets. I hope I didn&#x27;t like portray the countries in odd ways. It&#x27;s not meant this way. It&#x27;s meant to pique your curiosity and try to have you think about like what is it you can do. Maybe your framework, care about low end devices. When people use your framework, the user experience you&#x27;re going build is going to scale across the gamut of landscape\u00a0 sorry\u00a0 across the gamut of devices. Hopefully this is interesting enough for you it think what are the ways you can take those opportunities in mind when you build or create something. It could also just be making documentation. Making documentation available in more languages could also help.</p><p>And with that, I&#x27;m done. Thank you.</p>",

		"transcript": "<p>Okay. So, I am hoping that the talk yesterday set you up to think of some questions that you might want to ask our esteemed panel and to get started, I want to ask each of them to do a quick introduction to their areas of standardization and communities.</p><p>YULIA: My name is Yulia Startsev. I&#x27;m a delegate for Mozilla at TC39 that Jory introduced yesterday. And I&#x27;m one of three co-chairs of the standardizing body.</p><p>Great to be here. Wendy Seltzer, strategy counsel to the World Wide Web Consortium, the W3C. We do voluntary consensus standards for the web platform.</p><p>&gt;&gt; And today is the W3C&#x27;s?</p><p>&gt;&gt; 25th birthday!</p><p>&gt;&gt; Happy birthday, W3C.</p><p>I&#x27;m Aaron Parecki. I work at Okta. I have been in W3C and ITF. I do OAuth there. And the web community, I work on standards there as well.</p><p>And I&#x27;m Natasha Rooney. I work at a telecoms association. My experience is in W3C, IETF and standards bodies too.</p><p>So, quite a bit of experience on the stage. And in addition to those groups, we have folk here is from like what WG other standards communities. I think there&#x27;s quite a lot going on in these spaces. And a question I think I get a lot is like how do you discover where different work is happening? And are these groups collaborating with one another? So, I thought it might be interesting if we started chatting about how our groups are collaborating and what they&#x27;re working on. Wendy, do you want to start?</p><p>Sure. W3C. Our work at the application layer. So, we do a lot of liaison work with IETF and the protocols underneath that. We also more recently are working with the What Working Group which is doing the HTML standard. And we had a little bit of a challenge initially as, you know, there were two versions of the HTML spec and there was some incompatibilities between them.</p><p>And we decided that wasn&#x27;t a way for the web to work. The web demands compatibility and cooperation. And so, last year we formed a memorandum of understanding with the What Working.group. The What Working group has the HTML and DOM specs. And W3C has a cooperative relationship with our HTML working group helping to feed input and reviews and comments into the work. Both of us have similar work modes. They work in GitHub, we work in GitHub. W3C has a strong tradition of web for all that includes horizontal reviews, security, privacy, accessibility and internationalization. In working with the working group, we want to share that knowledge and the input of the broader web community with that group which is, you know, starts by being browser implementer focused. And also welcomes the broader input.</p><p>And so, you&#x27;ve raised a good point about that review process and kind of sharing this sort of oversight of certain pieces of work. Are there examples in your area that you can think of where that happens between the groups?</p><p>I was gonna sort of build on what Wendy was saying related to IETF and W3C a little bit more. More traditionally in standards bodies which are a little bit older, there&#x27;s usually a liaison. And that liaison is usually a person or sometimes a letter that gets sent between standards bodies to say we&#x27;re working this thing. And a teleco standards working on standards sent an email saying we&#x27;re doing this now. It&#x27;s a little bit better in incident and web standards bodies. And I think web RTC is involving standards at the protocol layer and on the web. There&#x27;s a working group in W3C and some groups in IETF. And although not both sets of people go to each other, there&#x27;s sort of a core group that will go to both.</p><p>So, I find that&#x27;s where the best collaboration happens. Where you got this core group of people which are dancing between both standards bodies and carrying things on. It&#x27;s a little bit more cohesive than that standard old liaison method.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Do you find that also ends up influencing the work and the processes of your groups?</p><p>&gt;&gt; Yes. Some good, it&#x27;s best when good practices get carried over. So, I can&#x27;t remember who started the GitHub thing. But I think actually W3C was quite forward in doing this. I don&#x27;t know about the other standards bodies. But mostly W3C and IETF. And then IETF picked up a lot on that GitHub usage. I&#x27;m talking about the development on that happening, labeling conversations, and collaborations. And brought that into IETF. I think that happened because the core individuals were dancing between these two groups. Yeah, it does happen.</p><p>We also sometimes have something that happens which is spec layering. So, we have people who are communicating across standards bodies. So, TC39 has liaisons from the CSS working group and WG and other places. But it&#x27;s interesting when we are working with a technical question. Recently had this with built in modules where part of the work was actually being worked in the Web IDL repository. This was a layering situation. It would be implemented in Web IDL and TC39 would be on top of that. That&#x27;s an interesting collaboration that happens across standards bodies.</p><p>Kind of getting back to GitHub and sort of that evolution of the process of making standards from more paper driven letters and things too, you know, kind of open source style development practices. I think W3C has been pretty on the forefront of that. There&#x27;s quite a few tools and, you know, repositories and stuff. TC39 also has recently been leading the way in some of this. I&#x27;m curious if you want to talk about some of the process we&#x27;re doing there.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Can you repeat the question?</p><p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was curious if you wanted to talk a little bit about the TC39&#x27;s process on GitHub and that kind of thing?</p><p>Right. We have a well defined process. I wasn&#x27;t sure if we wanted to talk about how we&#x27;re trying to open up the process or specifically the process document we have. We have a public document, PTC39 process. That outlines it. TC39 is unusual in that we operate on consensus. Not most of the room, in our case, it&#x27;s the entire room agrees. In this case, consensus means something a little bit more subtle. It&#x27;s that we don&#x27;t have a specific block against a feature.</p><p>And we work through four stages. Starting with stage zero, the strawman proposal. Which could be any idea. Anyone can propose a proposal to the TC39. And it gets presented to the committee. We discuss if we want to do some more work in it which would lead us into a broader discussion about what this feature would mean and represent. That is stage one. From stage two we move on, from stage one, move to stage two where we are doing more detailed design work around the process. Once the design is agreed to by the committee, we move to stage three, implementation. And getting feedback from users based on the implementations. And finally, once we have at least two implementations and we have agreed and taken whatever feedback comes from this stage, we move on to stage four where it&#x27;s considered part of the specification.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I had a question, actually. How does TC39 deal when you don&#x27;t have consensus?</p><p>So, that&#x27;s a really interesting question. And usually what happens is we would go and discuss further. Like, if someone blocks a proposal, then we would discuss further and see if we can work around the constraints that this person is presenting. This usually happens when a delegate has an invariant in mind. Something about the language that they believe very strongly shouldn&#x27;t change. For example, it might be a specific performance concern. Or something about usability that should not change. And they may block. This kind of a block usually comes at stage one or stage two. Sometimes we can get around it. Sometimes we can&#x27;t. Usually when we can&#x27;t, the proposal is stopped. However, we see resurgences of proposals, reimagining of ideas.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Go ahead.</p><p>This is fascinating. I&#x27;m learning a lot about this. This is very, very different from the way that both the OAuth working group and the IndieWeb community work. Which are very much more sort of bubbling up ground up where people just sort of throw something out there and then see what sticks. And I feel like in the OAuth group, I see a lot of different people working on different things in parallel. And not so much of a we are all building this one thing. But we&#x27;re all building many small things together. And the same with the IndieWeb community. Anybody can show up, propose an idea and it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re bringing it to this committee. You&#x27;re just bringing it into the community and see if anybody else is interested and willing to build it.</p><p>That&#x27;s interesting because we do have multiple proposals. But we have themes that organically develop in committee. For example, class based proposals. That is an interesting thing that happens in TC39.</p><p>think in W3C we also see, you know, a lot of work lately coming in through community groups. We have the web incubator community group and a whole range of topic specific community groups where people gather. Anyone can propose a community group, propose an idea. Start building it, start specing it out and bring it forward to a working group to put it on to the recommendation track.</p><p>And we as the W3C team and the community sort of evaluate, what&#x27;s the interest? Do we have something that&#x27;s likely to lead to multiple interoperable implementations? Which is one of the sort of necessary criteria for building to a W3C recommendation. Do we have enough interest from different parts of the community to make those implementations successful and useful? Go ahead. Then let\u2019s put that on the req track and see what we can make of it.</p><p>&gt;&gt; So, I&#x27;m curious if we see, based on kind of this quick discussion of the different processes here, common challenges between groups on standards making here? Like obviously decision making is one. Do you guys want to address challenges here?</p><p>I think that&#x27;s one of the reasons why I asked the question previously. Is developing standards on consensus the right way to do it? But it does make things very slow. And so, if you have people who are disagreeing, it can draw things out a lot. W3C, I have seen this happen. But it&#x27;s in a little bit of a better place. And IETF, this is quite prevailing at the moment because it&#x27;s been a large amount of work going forward to push security and encryption onto the Internet. And that&#x27;s sometimes met, some companies have come in with some ideas which have kind of combated this a little bit. And so, there&#x27;s sort of the decision makes around this gets dragged out a lot because of that. And work gets delayed because of that. That causes people to get frustrated.</p><p>So, it&#x27;s a tough thing. I think both standards bodies do have some methods, something written in their process document for voting. So, if there really is no way that you can get a consensus, there is a voting fallback mechanism. But I&#x27;ve seen it used incredibly rarely in W3C. A little bit more in IETF with the methods we were mentioning earlier</p><p>&gt;&gt; And the W3C has taken on an initiative that you have worked on, the process for busy people and the process for 2020 document. What is it to revise process? That&#x27;s the meta meta, right?</p><p>I write the process document for busy people. I&#x27;ll link into it later. I did a tenure on the AB, I was on the group, it is a group that looks after the process document and some of the rung of the W3C. One of the things we do is look after the processing document. It&#x27;s impossible to read. Even for someone with English as a first language, it was difficult. It was a simple document that bits got plunked on top of it. It became this monster.</p><p>We revised that to be easier to read and in simple English. I was proud, one of our colleagues who was Japanese translated it into Japanese. It was hard to do. This is not a legal document. It was a simplification of a legal document. I was proud about that. There is a great deal of work going on now with some very intelligent individuals to completely redo it and incorporate some very large pieces of work like evergreen standards. The name may have changed recently. Go ahead.</p><p>&gt;&gt; We face the tension between sort of agility and stability. Do we want standards that keep up with the tip of development in, you know, the most advanced implementation? Or do we want standards that you can refer to for a place that the platform is and will be for a period of time?</p><p>And, you know, different people want different set points there. So, we have been working on a process for continuous development, we&#x27;re now calling it, to build in some of the reviews and some of the patent commitments. W3C has a royalty free patent policy that ensures that anyone can implement a W3C spec without faces patent royalty demand from anyone else participating in spec development.</p><p>So, we want to incorporate those things into a continuously evolving document rather than saying, it&#x27;s only when it gets to recommendation at the end of the line that all of those assurances come in. And so, that is a fundamental change to the way the process has worked. And, you know, requires lots of different elements to work together. You know, we need to get the engineers and the lawyers talking together to make this process evolve effectively.</p><p>&gt;&gt; A nightmare scenario. Just kidding. We have been focusing a lot on these kind of formal groups. But I want to ask Aaron about process and decision making and community building in sort of those IndieWeb/open source spaces.</p><p>We do have a process as well for the specs that work through the IndieWeb community. It is much less strict. And there&#x27;s no, like, timelines involved. I guess the idea is to get it to something that is, we don&#x27;t ever consider a spec, like, final. We kind of treat everything as ever evolving because it&#x27;s meant to document the reality of the world rather than trying to be like a declaration. But, you know, we mostly follow the microformats process. Which has been written up. It has changed over time as well. We have gone through iterations on that in terms of what exactly it entails.</p><p>But, you know, the process does have to be written down otherwise it is just gonna be chaos.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. For sure. And then, you know, we were talking about how this also slows that\u00a0 a process can really be very slow moving. With the IndieWeb approach, it moves a little bit quicker. I think TC39 is interesting because of how we do the yearly standard. I wondered if you wanted to talk about that.</p><p>it is interesting. We have a rolling standard. We release the work we have done up to that point in the year as Ecma 2020. Everyone can make the joke, everything in hindsight is 2020. We do have a rolling spec. And the idea isn&#x27;t that each year we come out with a new spec. It&#x27;s really that we release the results of our work at that point. It&#x27;s also interesting how this rolls into the staging process. Because at stage three, we&#x27;re essentially sending it to implementers that it is now safe to implement because we will not be making significant design decisions at this point.</p><p>That&#x27;s an interesting thing, going back to your point about stability and agility. We want to be able to change our minds and address problems that come up with specifications. But at the same time, we need to give a strong signal that it&#x27;s safe to start implementing some very complex proposals. It&#x27;s also a balance of those things. And, yeah, just to round that back to our rolling release schedule, it&#x27;s sort of a point at which we make official that this is a recommendation from TC39.</p><p>&gt;&gt; So, learning all of these different processes, as we have been mentioning, is really, really difficult, right? W3C process document is a monster. It&#x27;s really hard for newcomers to learn. I&#x27;m curious what different organizations are doing to sort of make process more knowable, make it more agile, make it more responsive to the way people want to work. Like the more IndieWeb way, I suppose.</p><p>So, I think one thing that&#x27;s interesting coming from TC39 is our\u00a0how we work initiative. Which was partially based off of the work that Natasha did with the how to\u00a0 with the process document for busy people. Where we tried to write down our process and all of the culture around making standards at TC39 in a GitHub repository. That&#x27;s available and accessible to everyone who wants to take part in that. And also, part of that was releasing a website that&#x27;s geared towards developers rather than people who are already feeling comfortable working with spec language.</p><p>Because spec language is this weird space. Where it&#x27;s semi legal, very abstracted language. For good reason, I think, also.</p><p>I think that&#x27;s a big part of it - I don&#x27;t even necessarily see that defining the process is the barrier here. Feeling you can be part of the process is the barrier. Because spec language is such an obtuse way of describing something. It&#x27;s not the way you&#x27;re going to learn the concepts behind what&#x27;s going on and what&#x27;s in the document. It is for good reason. It serves its purpose that way. But I think you need to have that other way of presenting the ideas more focused to people who are going to be writing the software and writing software using the technology. And I think that is a big challenge of like how do you make a lot of people know that is something they can participate in and actually get involved in the development of the standards.</p><p>There&#x27;s a lot that standards bodies can still do in this area. I had some unbaked work, which is more sort of getting people up and running on W3C which I should revisit. One of the things that helped me as a new person within standards bodies was finding a mentor that was\u00a0and it wasn&#x27;t that I asked, will you be my mentor? There was just a few extremely helpful individuals that really started to help. So, if you are interested in getting involved, that was my number one thing. And actually, within W3C specifically, it was a Mozilla employee who became my mentor. Was co chair of my working group. Sorry, co chair of my interest group. And has been a long standing mentor for me within W3C. That&#x27;s a big tip if you&#x27;re getting started.</p><p>&gt;&gt; And I think the W3C has kind of started to experiment with buddy systems for TPAC and other systems.</p><p>Buddy systems and co-chairing. Chairing is a hard job and it&#x27;s 365 days a year. So, don&#x27;t ever chair by yourself. Don&#x27;t do that. It&#x27;s a tough gig.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Never chair.</p><p>So, a co chair really helps. And especially somebody who has a different skill set or different level of experience to you. And then eventually you will be that person who has that experience mentoring your co chair. That&#x27;s\u00a0what W3C is doing that now. IETF has been doing that for a long time. It&#x27;s a good group.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Are there other resources y&#x27;all can think of? I think when We have been experimenting with, it&#x27;s a little it&#x27;s baking right now. Is outreach groups for TC39. I don&#x27;t know if you want to mention that.</p><p>So, one thing that we&#x27;ve noticed in TC39, it&#x27;s often hard to bring people in and get their feedback. So, we&#x27;ve started directly reaching out to specific groups. For example, we have an outreach group for educators, an outreach group for tools and frameworks. And we go to them. Because we can be a little bit intimidating to talk to. And the goal there is to make sure that we get a broad view on how people are understanding our proposals. What places are our blind spots, what we&#x27;re not seeing. And these take the form of a monthly or bimonthly telecom calls. So, that&#x27;s something that we have been trying out.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I think W3C, both, you know, takes in ideas from the community and so, some of the innovations that we&#x27;ve seen recently. Moving to GitHub was spurred by community members saying this is where we do work. And, you know, let&#x27;s not use Mercurial or CVS checkouts anymore. But frame our issues through pull requests in GitHub. And that&#x27;s moved to most of our working groups. We do almost all of our work in public available to anybody to watch and participate in the discussion. And then, you know, we need membership for the patent commitments at the time that you&#x27;re trying to contribute to spec development.</p><p>So, we get from the community the idea of explainers and so, it&#x27;s not just the process. But sometimes the technology in a spec itself can be difficult to parse from the spec. So, an explainer written in simpler language of, what are we trying to do here? What will success look like? What&#x27;s required to make this API or feature effective? Goes into an explainer. And somebody else who sees that meeting a business use case can add even if they don&#x27;t have the technical knowledge of what it would require to fix that. Getting a broad sense of the demand for a fix can help spur others in the community to think about what would it take to address that need from web developers, from app developers, web apps.</p><p>And so, another piece that&#x27;s relatively stronger in W3C is the role of the team. We have a large team of technical experts team contacts who are there to help in making it a useful forum. And so, if at any point you&#x27;re trying to get engaged with the W3C group and can&#x27;t figure out, is this right? Feel free to reach out to the team contacts. We&#x27;re there to help steer you in the right direction.</p><p>&gt;&gt; The W3C is this group that has quite a bit of staff and management and that sort of stuff. What about the other groups? Do you have management? Is there a parent org that helps with any of this?</p><p>The IndieWeb is complete opposite. It&#x27;s just individuals working on stuff together. And we&#x27;re not even officially an organization. We&#x27;re just a community with a website. And it works.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Do you pay for the domain? I&#x27;m sorry. Somebody Patreon him some money.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Was that the \u201cwhere does the money come\u201d from question?</p><p>&gt;&gt; Jeremy Keith asked me to ask where does the money come from, but we can have a more nuanced conversation about the participation.</p><p>I can give info on IETF. It&#x27;s a non membership organization. If you want to participate in Internet standards, you can just do that. It&#x27;s a tough crowd, though. They&#x27;re up on their tech. And I learned this the hard way. If you go with a half baked solution, you&#x27;re gonna have a bad time. So, I&#x27;ll tell you about my bad time later. It was rather emotional. Yes, it is a tough crowd. But there&#x27;s no financial barrier to taking part. They have three meetings a year. The rest of it&#x27;s done over email.</p><p>So, and their remote participation for the meetings was very strong. I felt they have done some very good work in making it very access to believe people if you&#x27;re not able to travel. The money from IETF comes from a few different sources. With the three meetings they have a year, there is an attendee fee. I believe they get some money from the large Internet bodies as well. Exactly.</p><p>&gt;&gt; And ECMA</p><p>&gt;&gt; ECMA</p><p>&gt;&gt; You know as much as I do about this topic. Yeah. So, we are part of ECMA International. We&#x27;re a technical committee of that standards body. And so, they do have an exec com which Jory is part of. There&#x27;s a general assembly where they discuss all the standards bodies. But we have been given a lot of freedom to determine our process and how we work. And they&#x27;ve also helped us define our legal relationship with individuals who contribute things to the specification. Because this can be rather hairy. For example, in some cases in the US, you will have a company that says work that you produce on your free time is licensed to the company.</p><p>And as a result, we need to make sure that we&#x27;re in a good legal position that we can say that if someone implements the TC39 recommendation, then they are legally allowed to do so. Then\u00a0 and that&#x27;s an important legal protection. Which is, I think, part of the reason that we have the membership structure that we do. So, our membership structure is tiered. We have ordinary members. I believe that there are associate members. There&#x27;s another member who I think there&#x27;s small business numbers and finally NGOs. And they have different tiers depending on what the funding requirements for ECMA that year are.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I think you raised an interesting point, which is the impact of IPR on our groups and on our processes. Wendy, as our legal counsel on the stage, do you want to kind of maybe advise a little bit on the importance of that?</p><p>Well, I have to give the standard lawyer&#x27;s disclaimer that I&#x27;m not the room&#x27;s legal counsel. But I think we see a variety of approaches to IP. The primary concern tends to be patents. Nobody wants to be writing a specification only to find out afterwards that somebody claims patents on it. And demands royalties from anyone who implements or uses the technology. So, different organizations have different requirements. Some have a disclosure requirement. If you have or are aware of patents, you need to disclose to the org and the org maintains a record of those disclosures so that would be implementers can review to determine their own risk level and comfort with negotiating with those patent holders.</p><p>Others have so called RAND, reasonable and non discriminatory license terms where the patent holder can charge royalties so long as it&#x27;s the same royalty to everyone. and so long as it&#x27;s reasonable. Which is something that would have to be determined in a court of law if the parties can&#x27;t agree among themselves what a reasonable payment is. And on the way to royalty free, which is W3C policy. That&#x27;s saying anyone who participates in the group commits that any of their so called essential claims will be available royalty free.</p><p>So, anything that is necessary to implementation of the spec is available royalty free. Things that are optional features or extra add ons can still be licensed which opens up a business model of, you know, you allow everyone to use the standard and you sell enhancements. And companies do that. And that&#x27;s both a motivation to participate in the standards work, get the core standard deployed everywhere.</p><p>And then convince people that you who know the technology are best positioned to add enhancements on the edge end. If you want to pay for that performance upgrade or that additional feature, then there might be a royalty involved.</p><p>&gt;&gt; So, I think this tees up a question fairly well. Because, you know, that&#x27;s certainly accurate for\u00a0 what you just described as sort of the standard practice for standards in other industries, right? But we&#x27;re on the web and we value the open web. So, the question is, what are things that our standards groups are doing to make the standards process more open? Like, how are we making it more accessible? How are we making open standards licenses? Things like that. You know, more modern and open compared to the standards of yesteryear.</p><p>I&#x27;ll start. I think we work both the royalty free and the copyright licenses to permit anyone to download our specs. Many of our recent specifications at W3C use a forkable license that is not using copyright as a restriction on who can do other things with the license\u00a0with the spec. So, if you think we&#x27;re doing a bad job, you can take the work elsewhere and we need to convince people that this community is the best place to keep doing the work.</p><p>Because, you know, we don&#x27;t have the legal cudgel to stop them from taking it elsewhere.</p><p>With regards to sort of document creation and emails. Emails in IETF and in W3C, they are open. You can read them. Sometimes it&#x27;s difficult to get there. But they are available. And you can see document creation from the beginning. Some people will start to work on documents in editors drafts and their own GitHub repository. But once it reaches the IETF or the W3C, these documents are available to read whilst they&#x27;re being worked on. That happens freely.</p><p>And it&#x27;s so adverse to how things are done in the teleco space. In telecoms standards bodies, you need a login, you need to be a member. In some cases, you have to pay to read the standard when it is done. So, it\u2019s different, this industry. And it&#x27;s really great to see that movement.</p><p>I think that was actually one of the things that really pleased getting involved with the IETF and the OAuth working group. I found the mailing list, finding the people there, having the conversations and realized I was participating. That was it. I had already joined.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Oh, I&#x27;m sorry.</p><p>&gt;&gt; But, no, I think that works really well having all that happen so out in the open.</p><p>But to your point, that&#x27;s something you have to go actively searching for or stumble into. And that&#x27;s sort of a barrier in many ways for people getting involved. Another thing I&#x27;ve heard that prevents people from joining is sort of that reputation for these spaces being kind of hostile. And, you know, that&#x27;s not great. What are some of the things that our groups are doing to make\u00a0 to kind of\u00a0to change that? To change that culture?</p><p>In the IndieWeb community, everything is out in the open. Everything is CC0 license and out in the open. And we have a code of conduct where you are expected to follow it if you are participating in this community. We hold people to that. It&#x27;s a very core part of it. The goal is to create a space where people feel welcome to participate and join. And I hope it works.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Yes, speaking of the code of conduct. Since you sort of were a driving force for that at TC39. Can you talk a bit about ours?</p><p>Yeah. Sure. A lot of people don&#x27;t know, but we did at two and a half years ago adopt a code of conduct for TC39, the delegates that attend the committee. That was very important because we were getting a lot of feedback and certainly a reputation that it was a fairly hostile place and we had some really stressful moments. I&#x27;m proud of how the committee has turned around in terms of being willing to take that step. Which is a hard thing to do when we&#x27;re a consensus based group. So, we had to get 60 plus people to agree it that. Some of who had a problem with that, but that&#x27;s fine. Now we&#x27;re moving on. It&#x27;s been a really nice change. I think slowly we&#x27;ve started to see more of the conversations kind of tempered down. People, you know, apologizing, thanking each other. Like that kind of thing. And kind of really resetting the tone for professional conduct. Which is great. Because that&#x27;s what we need.</p><p>W3C has a code of ethics and professional conduct. And a group that is working on revisions to that to improve the welcome there. We also have had sort of recent introspection and work on diversity scholarships for our TPAC meeting to help people to attend and to recognize that our community is not as diverse as it could be. There are underrepresented voices. There are people for whom it&#x27;s more difficult to get the travel funding together.</p><p>And so, thanks to Samsung for helping to spearhead that initiative we&#x27;ve had over the past two years. The diversity scholarship fund with member and individual support that&#x27;s helped to bring I think this past year it was seven people to the TPAC meeting. And, you know, all of that is to recognize that, you know, standards are only as good as the inclusive community that helps to make them.</p><p>So, let me ask one final question which is, you know, what can the folks here do to get involved with your communities? What can, you know, if you were gonna leave them with one directive to come participate and get involved, what would you ask them or tell them to do?</p><p>So, it&#x27;s also interesting to look at this from the perspective of\u00a0one place. Okay. So, context. I ran a survey last year about\u00a0 asking developers what their relationship with TC39 was and how they wanted to participate. And that actually shed a lot of light. Because from our perspective, it was everyone wanted to do a proposals, propose a change to the language, get a feature in. But from the survey, a lot of people were like, I want to help, but I&#x27;m not too sure how or where to start from. You can write tests. In TC39, check out our test 262 on TC39&#x27;s GitHub page. And there are lots of really friendly people who will help you get started writing tests. Other people were saying they wanted to help with documentation. And people were also say, I would love to give feedback, but I don&#x27;t know how. And we haven&#x27;t fully addressed this yet. We&#x27;re trying to get some documentation together. This is something that we&#x27;re actively working on to help people know how to give feedback and things like this.</p><p>Two places to get engaged. Any of our review groups, if you&#x27;re interested in security or privacy or accessibility or internationalization, we have reviews on all of those. And we&#x27;re always looking for people to help in doing those so called horizontal reviews. And if you have technical proposals or places you think the web could do better, check out the strategy funnel where we collect ideas and proposals and see either vote something up that&#x27;s already in there or add an idea to the mix.</p><p>I would say the easiest way to get involved in the IndieWeb community is join the chat channel. It&#x27;s available on IRC, Slack, matrix and disorder. All are the same room, chat.IndieWeb.org. Come to a web camp and meet people in person. See what you&#x27;re interested in and what specs you&#x27;re willing to help develop or build things with. It&#x27;s a very friendly community, welcoming. We have an IndieWeb camp this week in New York and in two weeks in Brighton. So, lots of opportunities to join.</p><p>I would say for the W3C, the WICG incubator group is an interesting one to join. To see what ideas are coming in from the community, you can join the mailing list and get the emails from that. The other thing is start talking or speaking at events. That&#x27;s what I did. I started being a bit of a fan person for service worker. I kind of really locked on to that really early on. It was because of the explainer document that Wendy referenced earlier. I was to explain the documents and I started talking about that and the work that was happening there. Also, just reach out to somebody on Twitter or another social media platform. There are some people in standards that are desperate for people to help. Do that mental thing and reach out to them and say I want to work on this. They will be so happy.</p><p>And I want to share two quick references. The web compat work from Mike Taylor&#x27;s group is a great place to check out how to get involved in spec bugs and things like that. The web we want is another great place that&#x27;s collecting ideas for, you know, gaps in the platform.</p><p>Just one last thing about TC39, if you&#x27;re interested and you just want a starting place that will give you lots of resources, TC39&#x27;s website, TC39.es has a lot of things and you can take a look.</p><p>Thank you so much for your answers to questions. We&#x27;re out of time.</p>",

		"transcript": "<p>Hello! Thanks. Good to hear you. I wanted to play a little game to get started and that is called Unlocking my Computer. But also, let&#x27;s do this. I want some participation. Humor me. I say view, you say source!</p><p>Thank you. You&#x27;re the greatest crowd. I can&#x27;t see any of you but I love you very, very much.</p><p>My name is Tejas, that is pronounced like &quot;contagious disease.&quot; I don&#x27;t have anything. I won&#x27;t give you anything except a good talk. I work at a company in Germany. We help our customers access their own data. Really, what I love about my job is the people I work with, like these are the people I go see every day and they are smart and funny and all kinds of wonderful. We&#x27;re not even hiring right now.</p><p>But, we&#x27;re not here to talk today, about me, we&#x27;re here to talk about the CSS, the style sheets that cascade. We&#x27;ll talk about CSS kind of how it was back in the day. We look at CSS then and we&#x27;ll look at CSS, today, and we might\u00a0 if there&#x27;s time\u00a0do some CSS that&#x27;s coming up. We have quite a bit of content. CSS, back then, was marvelous. I started with CSS, when I was 8 years or 10 years old and it was very different. Something, like animating graphics was not easy, like, you&#x27;d usually have to have something like this. This is a JIF or GIF. They didn&#x27;t support many things back in the day.</p><p>Moreover, to do things like this was really difficult and when you did it, you felt this, like, satisfaction. Whoa! I created something with rounded corners, a drop shadow. This, in my day\u00a0wow, I sound old. Back in my day...back in my day, this was a tabular layout with three columns and the top left had a GIF. And the top right was a rounded corner. It was hacks upon hacks upon hacks. And in some cases, we did a background image of this fixed size box and we&#x27;re very careful with padding to not overflow it because if we did, everything would be great.</p><p>Sometimes we&#x27;d get the rounded corners wrong.</p><p>And your box would kind of bleed out of your hack and I tell you these things because I want to just appreciate that all of these things and hacks that we once used to write are now two lines. Yeah, that is worthy. Moreover, I used to struggle with layouts. I don&#x27;t struggle with layouts anymore. What is clear fix? Growing up, I struck clear both. What does that mean? And I think I didn&#x27;t even figure this out when Flexbox became a thing. This is how we used to do side by side column in our layout. This hack or workaround has been reduced to more or less one line. Incredible.</p><p>So what I&#x27;m here to tell you today, I tell you these things to drive home the point that CSS is evolving and CSS is growing fast and is enabling all kinds of beautiful user experiences on the web. In fact, because CSS is evolving, today, we need to take about CSS on today&#x27;s platform. It might evolve before we stop and appreciate it today. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;d like to do with you. We&#x27;ll talk, in detail, about three topics. First one is layout. We won&#x27;t spend a lot of time here, because again, oh, my goodness. I learned so much. I didn&#x27;t even know you could animate Grid. I&#x27;m going to play with it when I go to work.</p><p>Second is typography.</p><p>And, third, extensibility. We need to move a little bit fast, so let&#x27;s get right into it.</p><p>Layout, I&#x27;m not going to spend a lot of time on layout. Wonderful talks before. I will go through the way we do Layout and answer one question that comes at me very often, like, even in my job today. Let&#x27;s try and do this. So, I&#x27;d like to show you, we&#x27;re going to write\u00a0,as Ruth said, I&#x27;ve been talking quite a bit, so I&#x27;m going to write in code for most of this. So, let&#x27;s make a folder. Let&#x27;s call it &quot;talk.&quot; I&#x27;m going to go into it. Can you y&#x27;all see? Is that font size okay? Okay. Two of you are\u00a0wonderful.</p><p>I&#x27;m going to make an HTML file. Let&#x27;s get the font size up here and we&#x27;ll write an HTML. I&#x27;ll do a shortcut and a box and another box and we&#x27;ll say this is box one and this is box two. I want to illustrate a use case that actually people on my team actually ask me about. We&#x27;ll trade another CSS file that we&#x27;ll reference right here. I think it&#x27;s &quot;link.&quot; Cool. Index.CSS. And, let&#x27;s spin up an HTTP server. That, with no cache. And so what we have running here is literally nothing. I&#x27;m so proud of myself. This is the pinnacle of my career right here. Blank page. Technically, it&#x27;s fast because there&#x27;s no code.</p><p>Let&#x27;s write some code, so let&#x27;s give our boxes some color. Let&#x27;s say &quot;background, red.&quot; With 50, height 50. And let&#x27;s see what they look like. They look like nothing. I think I may have written some, what is that? They&#x27;re both red. I want to distinguish them. So box two has a background. So, Layout, positioning things is what people sometimes struggle with. I want them side by side and so I see this on the web today, where we&#x27;ll try to do something like this. I don&#x27;t fault you. That works. But there&#x27;s some odd space between them. If we inspect this, there&#x27;s no margin or anything splitting them up here.</p><p>What we see is that there&#x27;s just space between them. That&#x27;s okay. But what happens if the height of the second one is uneven? So, if I have these, right? And it goes to the bottom for some reason, I&#x27;ll use vertical align on top and this follows. I&#x27;ll use vertical alignment middle because really, I want it centered and it goes under the bottom. I don&#x27;t know. This is not to ridicule the platform, this is something I&#x27;ve struggled with and other engineers have struggled with. There is the bottom, but not quite the bottom, but baseline is. This is something we collaborate on extensively on pull requests at my work.</p><p>There&#x27;s Flexbox, 90+ percent of people have heard of and use Flexbox. It moves the responsibility of Layout to the parent, which is kind of where I&#x27;m going and I believe that&#x27;s the way to do it. We will remove the rest of the inline block stuff. So the children don&#x27;t know about their placement, the parent does. We want a gap between them. This doesn&#x27;t work in Chrome, but it does in Firefox. It&#x27;s coming.</p><p>Instead, let&#x27;s talk briefly about how we space these children. Who owns the margin? Some would say, well, do margin right on both or one. And so do that. There, they&#x27;re spaced. Is that the best solution? I&#x27;m not convinced. And I&#x27;m not convinced because in a situation, say on mobile where children would wrap\u00a0and we&#x27;ll simulate that.</p><p>This, which kind of looks okay, except you&#x27;ve lost your gap and there&#x27;s some ghost margin going on here. This is accentuated if you apply a margin left to the second child and you have this odd space offset. Who should own the margin? And my answer, from experience, that seems the most correct to me, I may be wrong, correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, the answer of who owns the margin seems to be the parent. So, if we turn this flex into a grid, we can get rid of this simulation here and what we do is describe our grid template columns to be min content.</p><p>We have the same layout. What happens on mobile? I could query and specify a different CSS layout. And that&#x27;s what it looks like. So, to answer the question for layout, who owns the margin? For me, the answer is the parent. The parent kind of lays things out and the children sit there and look absolutely pretty.</p><p>Next topic, typography. On the web, typography allows us to do incredible things. We create these experiences, on the web, that allow people to feel things. It&#x27;s about expression. We do that with fonts. Unfortunately, however, fonts have come under fire, particularly the famous web fonts. Some of them can be quite heavy. You ship a lot of code. You ship 100 kilobytes of just fonts because you load character sets and glyphs that maybe you don&#x27;t need. You can compress them. But there could be a way you could help this and this is kind of my goal to talk about this.</p><p>I want to show you a trick I learned from the documentation of Google Fonts. Let&#x27;s go back here. Let&#x27;s go to Google Fonts and what we&#x27;ll see a beautiful set of fonts. Let&#x27;s use big shoulders display. I like this name. I&#x27;d like big shoulders someday. There seems to be a bug here, I guess it works on a wider layout. Is it open? There we go. And I will - that&#x27;s good feedback for you Google, I love you.</p><p>Let&#x27;s try to serve. Let&#x27;s import that font right here and tell the body tag in CSS everything is now big shoulders. Font family is Big Shoulders display and fall back to a serif if you can&#x27;t find the glyphs. And that looks like\u00a0 we need text, of course. H1. View Source! Woohoo! Save, there we go. So, it looks like, this looks pretty cool. But let&#x27;s look at the network. What am I loading here? I&#x27;m loading 11.9 kilobytes, which is really not that bad. Can we do better?</p><p>I&#x27;ve learned that you can pre shake your fonts, which is quite cool. I have View Source here. Let&#x27;s say I want to load those just from Google Fonts. I can do that by going to this\u00a0where are we? Here, and adding a query and text and equals these characters, maybe the exclamation point and reload. So, this is the font, but this is serif and we&#x27;re loading one kilobyte. We can even, you probably shouldn&#x27;t, you should find a better way to do this. I&#x27;m just going to\u00a0 whatever. Let&#x27;s try this: .replace. Globally with nothing. So, we&#x27;ve stripped the spaces.</p><p>I love the web. And then we&#x27;ll save this and now we&#x27;re loading just the glyphs on the page, from 11 kilobytes to 3.2 kilobytes. You&#x27;re shipping less code. That makes the impact, the performance impact, from your web font significantly less. This is where variable fonts come into play. Variable fonts are incredible. They allow you to express different types of typography, pun intended, with just one font. And this is great for performance, but also, it&#x27;s great for sending fewer requests and waiting for fewer responses.</p><p>Just imagine your user, in a country where the internet is intermittent or going through a train, right? You don&#x27;t want to load in this odd state of &quot;I have some of the font, but not all.&quot; And then you have all kinds of flash content. You allow one font file and then tweak them. A great example of this is this, ampersand is a web typography conference. On this page, I&#x27;d encourage you to go explore. There&#x27;s, I think, two fonts, if not less. They&#x27;re variable using axes. It is equivalent to parameters. Think about a function in JavaScript. There with built in axes, kind of standard, I&#x27;d say that have CSS equivalence, these axes which will use an italicized font. There&#x27;s the slint or slant. It will maintain the baseline and slightly slant them.</p><p>There&#x27;s weight, thickness. There is width, which is the width of the font, how wide are your glyphs? This optical size, I love, because it helps you with, let&#x27;s say, when your text is smaller, it will emphasize it more. When it&#x27;s bigger, they get more gentle strokes.</p><p>These have equivalence in CSS rules, that these, essentially,can help you think about them a little bit better. How you use and customize them are through this CSS property, Font Variation Settings. When you use it, it looks like this. It&#x27;s kind of like a key value pair. You have the axis and the number, comma separated, until you&#x27;re happy with what it looks like. I&#x27;d love to show you a practical application of this, in a little bit of a demo.</p><p>What we&#x27;ve got here is just a font. I&#x27;m just going to pull up my variable font here. I&#x27;ll just paste it in here. Now, it&#x27;s available to us. It&#x27;s called &quot;recursive.&quot; It is free, open source and beta. If you want to play, GitHub. We have font, is that big enough? Cool. Font face. I&#x27;ll say the family of my font is recursive and it&#x27;s located right here. That&#x27;s all I&#x27;m going to do and I&#x27;m going to say &quot;use recursive&quot; instead of the other thing. And what we&#x27;ll see is I have recursive. Recursive is a monocode spacing font. Let&#x27;s say, I think this is too rigid, this is too straight. Let&#x27;s explore how we can do that. Font variation settings and we&#x27;ll customize a custom axis. You can do font axes. Let&#x27;s use a custom axis. They&#x27;re expressed with all caps letters, that&#x27;s how you know they&#x27;re custom. Let&#x27;s set it to one and see what happens.</p><p>So, the expression, as you can see, has changed to be a little bit more playful. Let&#x27;s look at zero. It&#x27;s harder. In fact, you can transition between them. We say &quot;body on hover,&quot; I want to have a more playful approach. And we&#x27;ll transition font variation, settings,\u00a0.6 seconds. Okay. And what we&#x27;ll see is when I hover, things get a little more playful. Let me zoom in. Look at that. You see that transition? Incredible. We can also use a default axis for weight. And we&#x27;ll set it to 400, here, and then transition to 900. So, make it really, like, thick. Look at that. And that is just one font with so many different variations.</p><p>You can fine tune, do all the design work you want to and that is variable fonts. I&#x27;m really excited about it because it&#x27;s good performance with good customization and a better user experience on speed and with typography. Variable fonts is supported by 86% of browsers. It&#x27;s part of CSS today. Vfonts.com is the place to do that.</p><p>The last topic is extensibility. I love CSS. CSS is so sophisticated. Have you ever thought about what happens when you write &quot;display grid&quot; or &quot;display text&quot;? People say it&#x27;s not a real program language because it&#x27;s so beautifully declarative. It is sophisticated. There&#x27;s an engine underneath. So far, we wouldn&#x27;t tap into it. According to a new set of APIs, you can tap into the engine and make CSS do its magic and extend it. That is so\u00a0that should get you excited, if it doesn&#x27;t already. Just imagine the things you can do.</p><p>Houdini, let&#x27;s do a demo. I&#x27;ve been talking too much. Let&#x27;s go and look at some stuff. So, we&#x27;re going to look at a website, by the one and only Surma, who spoke before. This is &quot;ishoudinireadyyet.com&quot;. There are two things that have shipped in Chrome. And these, really exciting. Let&#x27;s dive right into them.</p><p>The first one is typed OM. This is an object model. There&#x27;s a global CSS object available to you on the browser, that allows you to do all kinds of interesting things. For example, you don&#x27;t really need to work anymore with strings, like 10 pixels. Instead, you could say this and you get a typed value of pixels, which you can use for calculations and other things.</p><p>Typed OM are making things possible. Part of that is animating gradients. I&#x27;m almost out of time, so I might move a little bit fast. Background is a linear gradient, 45 degrees, you know, it&#x27;s green to white. Nothing magic here. And then,\u00a0let&#x27;s use keyframes even, why not? Change. From this, white, to instead of green to white, we&#x27;ll do blue to white. And then we&#x27;ll set the animation, here, animation, there we go. Change. And it&#x27;ll take one second. Go infinitely, alternative, so go back and forth and watch. Nothing, really.</p><p>Oh, forgot a semicolon. It&#x27;s not JavaScript. Sorry. It flashes and doesn&#x27;t doing anything. With type OM, we&#x27;ll look at how to animate this smoothly. We need a JavaScript for this and we will register a property. This will use CSS Local Properties and tell it, it&#x27;s a color property. Its name is &quot;color stop.&quot; It inherits, it really does. And its initial value, its default is black. We&#x27;ll animate the property. It&#x27;s color stop and it was green, we will move it to blue. We will reference the variable. Color stop. Now, as you can see, animating doesn&#x27;t work. But with this approach, we have a\u00a0 watch. I need to inject the JavaScript. Whoever said that saved my talk. Give that person a hug. All right. Let&#x27;s take a look see.</p><p>There we go. We have a smooth transition. I have to say, a lot of tech bros have told me, no, that&#x27;s possible. Just have a pseudo element above it or phase out its opacity or have a white background and animate background position. ut my friends, these are workarounds. These are, like, having a tabular layout with three columns and background images. I can tap into the engine and do it myself and that is what I&#x27;m excited about. Now, we have five minutes and I want to do some more coding. If I go over time, I apologize, please don&#x27;t shut me down.</p><p>Last thing, I promise, is we&#x27;re going to look at the paint API. The paint\u00a0.CSS paint API. We need to write CSS, CSS.paint.addmodule. They work in worker threads. Pw.js. All right. We will create a file &quot;pw.js.&quot; So my thing, they have a paint method here, with a context. This is the context on which you draw.</p><p>So, we have this. And we will register paint. The name of my worklet is, I don&#x27;t go, Dots My thing. &quot;I&#x27;ll go here and style the H1. How you use paint worklets, I&#x27;ll say background is Paint Dots. Let&#x27;s fix that. So, we have a context. And we will begin a path. And we will set the fill style to red. We&#x27;ll draw a circle. Eight pickets by eight pixels. Radius is eight pixels. Start angle is zero. And we will CTX.fill. This should, we have a red bull. What I&#x27;m doing is I&#x27;m hooking into CSS and exposing this beautifully declarative API. I could do anything I want. I could draw the face of, like, Remi. I can do all kinds of things. So just imagine an ecosystem of paint worklets that give you unique effects, maybe not so unique if they&#x27;re distributed. We&#x27;re maintaining the beautiful, declarative nature while giving developers super powers.</p><p>The layout API in Houdini allows you to get in the display property. Display flex or display grid, you can say display masonry. This is the power of Houdini.</p><p>With that, I&#x27;m super excited about it. Then there&#x27;s an animation worklet with you can turn the scroll bar into a seeker. I&#x27;m getting ahead of myself. It&#x27;s very, very, very exciting. And with that, let&#x27;s talk takeaways.</p><p>What do we want to come away with, with this talk? I crafted it thinking about, I love CSS. I&#x27;ve loved CSS, I&#x27;ve loved the hacks, I&#x27;ve loved watching it become more declarative. CSS has come a really long way. Do you remember the first few slides? We had rounded corners with GIFs that overflowed. It is developing rapidly, oh, my, CSS is just a global thing in JavaScript, there&#x27;s a working group that is working and cares about developers. You can do border radius, that&#x27;s because they&#x27;re listening. CSS is a real programming language. If I&#x27;m a CSS engineer, that&#x27;s a thing. People said, go push your pixels, leave the engineers to the Javascript developers. CSS\u00a0 my friend, Adam, says it so eloquently. CSS is the easiest language to pick up but the hardest to perfect. He said this at a social event.</p><p>So, with that, the last thing I&#x27;ll share is CSS is open and I&#x27;d invite you to get involved because it&#x27;s really, really, really, exciting.</p><p>Thank you for listening to me. I appreciate your time. Thank you very much.&quot;</p>",

		"transcript": "<p>Thanks. These talks have been amazing, right? I think so. I think it makes us all really appreciative to be a part of this community and just go back to work and be super excited.</p><p>My name is Lillian Kravitz, later in this talk, you&#x27;re going to hear from my colleague, Ryan Cropp. We both work on Microsoft Edge and we&#x27;re really excited. This seems to be a huge theme, going forward, and definitely something to talk about.</p><p>Today, we&#x27;re going to talk about a fresh perspective, a set of challenges we are facing today, as browsers. We are going to touch upon customer research, privacy principles, our new privacy feature, as well as a little bit about the technical implementation and then we&#x27;ll talk about the future of online privacy.</p><p>In the past, we used to put Microsoft at the center. We were solving problems with Microsoft at top of mind. But now we&#x27;re solving problems through a different lens, we&#x27;re putting the customer in the center. We have learned that we do not know all of the answers when it comes to the web. We also know that we are not solely responsible for the web. Developers and search engines, governments, advertisers and publishers, surfers of the web, together we create the web. Together, we create a massive industry and economy.</p><p>We learn from our customers that our previous browser was not meeting their needs from a web compatibility perspective. It was also affecting web developers ability. So by putting the customer in the center, we learned we needed to realign our priorities. We made a new browser based off of Chromium. It forces us to look at the browser and look at the web from a different perspective.</p><p>While listening to customers and their modern technology problems, a signal we heard, loud and clear, is that privacy is a huge issue on the internet. We began, as a team, to look at the privacy space as researchers and learners, not experts. We went out to learn about what privacy looks\u00a0 and feels like\u00a0 today. In 2019, there are a lot of proposals to improve privacy and &quot;do not track&quot; change standards, limit fingerprinting and identity. There&#x27;s a lot to keep track of in terms of regulations on data collection and data use.</p><p>If you think it&#x27;s complicated in an audience full of web developers, just imagine what it&#x27;s like for everyone trying to get online and get things done. If you&#x27;re going on the internet and trying to plan a weekend trip, privacy isn&#x27;t necessarily top of mind, but hacks and data breaches, compromised passwords and GDPR banners are scary for the technically inclined. Before we get started, it&#x27;s important to note that we&#x27;ve all learned from each other in the tech industry when it comes to online privacy.</p><p>No one is necessarily right or wrong. We&#x27;re starting our journey from scratch and that&#x27;s what we did and this is our story over the past year. We hope you can take something from it and apply it from your day to day. We would more than appreciate continuing the conversation with all of you afterwards.</p><p>The web community is a diverse and dynamic set of customers from every day cat watchers, avid video gamers, web developers and business entrepreneurs. We think it&#x27;s important that all voices are heard, to build the best web for everyone. We started this journey building a new browser by asking users a simple question: If you can change one thing about the web, what would it be? And I heard this conversation happening at this conference, as well. So when we asked our users, we got about 5,000 responses. And the number one response wasn&#x27;t super interesting. It was speed and performance. Users still want a faster and performant browser experience, not surprising. So, we should spend all of our time on this, right?</p><p>The second piece of feedback was privacy and trust. Users are saying they want privacy on the web. They want trust with their browser. But still speed and performance was the number one ask.</p><p>The third piece of feedback, it was advertisements, also not super surprising. Users are asking for less ads on the web. But when you look through the comments and read all of them, you see that users are specifically asking for ads that don&#x27;t track them. They&#x27;re saying things like, I want less creepy ads. Therefore, if you put together the privacy and feedback items with the users that are asking for ads that don&#x27;t track them, it becomes the number one thing that user are asking for, to change about the web.</p><p>So users are telling us that they want privacy. They are saying, I want trust with the browser. And in their words, I think the number one response was users literally just saying more privacy. This really caused us to realign and focus on what users are telling us. So after learning that privacy is top of the mind, we went out and interviewed customers about how they manage their online privacy. We heard from users that they think most about their online privacy when creating a new account. Reading about news, about privacy and hacks and breaches. Purchasing something on the internet. Or, seeing ads based on their previous browsing.</p><p>And we heard from users that they try and help this. They try and fix their privacy. They go into the settings, but they get lost because there&#x27;s too many. They download an extension because a friend told them to. Or, they do nothing because users tell us that they feel helpless at this time of technology and online privacy.</p><p>So after listening to dozens of users, our team started to quickly brainstorm and figure out how to solve these problems technically. We quickly realized that we were doing things out of order. We had to stop and take a step back and create a set of privacy principles that our team can stand by. We are calling our privacy principles, our Hippocratic Oath. Doctors take a Hippocratic Oath to behold standards for their patients. So we developed a Hippocratic Oath that we, as developers, can behold for our users.</p><p>We have responsibility. I mean, all of us, in this room, have a responsibility, as creators of the web. And it took us time to develop exactly what our responsibility is. This is not a simple technical problem. There is no clear answer to privacy. And we need to be cognizant of the fact that online privacy affects developers, publishers and advertisers, as well as browsers and it also affects users and their experience that they have on the web.</p><p>The laws have not fully caught up to the degree of power that we have, as developers. We therefore need to self regulate and at the end of the day, we need to do what is right for our users around the world. We developed four principles that we, as a team, can truly standby and they are control, transparency, respect and protection. Control. We will put you in control of your data. And whether you want us to delete that data or use it to improve your experiences. Transparency, we&#x27;ll inform you when, where and whom is collecting data. Respect. We will always respect you and your choice. And if you do not want us to collect any information. Protection. We will protect your personal information and prevent unauthorized access to it and never share it unless we inform you.</p><p>Now with our new privacy principles, we went back to brainstorming. From the interviews, surveys, we identified a top problem customers were facing. Users told us, one of their biggest concerns was to stop sites unassociated with their browsing, from collecting data about them. We dove into this more. What exactly does this mean? What we heard was, I&#x27;m browsing for something on the internet and then I seen an ad for it immediately. I&#x27;m uncertain who is collecting data about me. I feel creeped out by the ads that are following me. I don&#x27;t want my browsing being tracked.</p><p>Selena mentioned this earlier. One of the most common stories that we heard in our interviews, over and over again, when just asking customers about it. My husband and I were having a conversation and we talked about a diapers and then I got ads for it immediately and it feels creepy. We heard this type of story, over and over again, and people were telling us it&#x27;s just happening to them and no one else. It&#x27;s really indicating there&#x27;s a problem across multiple technologies, devices and apps. There was another signal we heard, and it was very loud. It&#x27;s different from what we heard, previously. It makes the internet more personal to me.</p><p>So, we have this clear signal from users saying they hate being tracked. But then from the same segment of customers, they tell us that they find the personalized content useful. So how can we solve a problem that is both a privacy concern, but also a useful feature of browsing? We use the specific signals that we heard from our customers, our new privacy principles to develop tracks prevention and now Ryan is going to continue to talk about putting our solution into the browser.</p><p>RYAN CROPP: All right. Thank you, Lillian. So, as we&#x27;ve discussed, we&#x27;ve heard a wide range of interest from our users about privacy. And, we got the feeling that there wouldn&#x27;t be one solution for privacy that would fit everyone, but probably a balanced approach, with options, could be the way forward. So, given our privacy principles, let&#x27;s look at tracking prevention as one of our first outputs and an example of how we can build privacy respecting principles for everyone.</p><p>There were a lot of ways we could have gone about it. Should we give them one privacy toggle, like enabling a VPN, blocking third party access, blocking resource load ads and randomizing browsing data and saying you&#x27;re protecting? While it&#x27;s certainly possible, there are problems. With one switch, there&#x27;s little control. On and off doesn&#x27;t give the granularity that people have asked us for and it wouldn&#x27;t be respectful of their needs. There&#x27;s no transparency behind the scenes to get a better understanding.</p><p>Instead of one solution for all problems, we decided we were just going to start small and build one solution for tracking inside the browser.</p><p>So, we know that online trackers are historian collecting a lot of data about users. Users are seeing the affects through personalized ads, but not really seeing the full picture because the data is collected without their knowledge, behind the scenes. While tracking prevention is not a new feature, other browser vendors restrict online trackers. Because we aren&#x27;t the first here, we&#x27;re able to learn from our community of developers, browsers and users to build tracking prevention that adheres to our privacy principles.</p><p>From our research, we knew this, there was one group of people who want maximum privacy. We can&#x27;t block everything because that breaks the web. Monetization and experiences like sign in and segment sharing stops working. A second group of people like seeing personalized ads. But we can&#x27;t also doing nothing because malicious data tracking is causing problems. There are people who enjoy personalized ads.</p><p>And then the third and last group we heard from thought it would be great if they didn&#x27;t see so many creepy ads and they liked the web the way it is. They would like to know more about what&#x27;s happening behind the scenes. Overall, people gave us very different feedback, but we had to design a feature that helps everyone. For us, tracking prevention was designed with the thought that results matter. Most people don&#x27;t know the setting exists or change it at all. Our implementation protects you by default with blocking in the background, to automatically keep your privacy protected.</p><p>And so, we set out with three different options to create tracking prevention. We have three different options that give the user control, with the middle selection where most people will fall and choices on both sides of the spectrum. We have three levels of basic tracking prevention, which are basic, balanced and strict. Basic is for the person who wants the web to be personalized to them. Balance is for people who want the web to work the way it works now. Strict is for people who want strict privacy.</p><p>&#x27;ll give a brief overview of trackers. Our first implementation, we used an open source list of tracking domain, we&#x27;re working with others to make sure it is agnostic and we don&#x27;t give any special treatment to an entity. We&#x27;re helping to update it to improve web compatibility. There are various trackers that are restricted differently depending upon each setting. More malicious trackers are blocked across all levels. Nobody should want these types of trackers in their browser. There are other types of trackers that show up. Because these trackers are more nuanced, they&#x27;re restricted differently across each setting.</p><p>In basic, we blocked the most malicious trackers and allow all others. In balance, we&#x27;ll block storage access and advertising and social media trackers. People will still see ads, but not have the creepiness of ads and diapers. In strict, we block resource and storage access from advertising analytics and social media trackers. As many ad resources are capable of tracking, this has an effect of blocking some advertisers, as well.</p><p>And, for developers who want to see the effects of how all these enforcements should play out, you can check out the developers tool console where we list the different types of requests, whether it&#x27;s from a script. We want the default experience to have no impact on web compatibility. If you&#x27;re using our new Edge browser, spend us a smile or a frown to let us know what&#x27;s going on. It should be great if you and your experience.</p><p>As we gather more feedback, we are working to strive compatibility and increase privacy. So, after creating our first version of tracking prevention, we took a step back and looked at our principles from our Hippocratic Oath to make sure we lived up to our standards. We have a block trackers view that provides transparency. And, we&#x27;re respecting the user&#x27;s choice. It can only solve one problem we learned from our users and there are many more privacy problems we can write for new solutions. Our team is excited to keep learning from customers.</p><p>On that note, Microsoft recently participated in the privacy web workshop. The two day discussion was a big step and to build mutual understanding and find a common ground so we can collaborate in the open to preserve privacy. We discussed the need to work together to find shared solutions for publishers, governments, monetization and privacy.</p><p>This was an incredible effort toward alignment to the future of the web. In those talks, all browser vendors shared proposals, including policies. We proposed a tracker audit program for transparency, control and respect. This could help preserve the economic part.</p><p>One of the biggest outcomes of this privacy workshops was the initial planning for the creation of a group of the W3C. It will allow all participants to collaborate on the vision of the future of privacy on the web. This is a new and continued effort. We&#x27;re really looking forward to more progress on this in the future.</p><p>What does the future of privacy look like? Is it that&#x27;s there will be no privacy? Will you have to pay for privacy, such that your privacy&#x27;s only protected if you&#x27;re willing to pay for it? Will you be paid for your data, such that you are paid for letting your data be collected? We have to specify what data&#x27;s being collected about you?</p><p>Overall, there&#x27;s a lot of tough questions we have to go out and solve and solutions we&#x27;re continuing to look for and excited to keep exploring.</p><p>So, when we went out and asked our customers, if we could have a magic wand and change one thing about privacy online, what would it be? We heard, privacy at the click of a button, or three levels of privacy online, like, low, medium, high, or regulations or transparency on the type of data that&#x27;s collected. These are genuine and basic asks. Users aren&#x27;t asking for anything complicated. It&#x27;s just basic needs.</p><p>What they&#x27;re asking for is transparency on what&#x27;s being collected, how to control and manage their data and so maybe it&#x27;s time for us to be respectful and honest with users and to simply protect them. So that&#x27;s where we are, with our privacy journey. It&#x27;s a forever changing landscape. Problems that exist today won&#x27;t necessarily exist in five years.</p><p>It&#x27;s our shared responsibility, as browser vendors, and developers, to keep asking questions, keep users privacy as a top priority and to keep listening. We must continue the loop of researching, identifying problems, solving those problems and iterating again. Because privacy&#x27;s a humbling space. It requires a balance with our customers top of mind.</p><p>So, as you can probably tell, we are super interested in learning from customers and that includes developers. We&#x27;d like to continue the conversation with all of you about the privacy problems you face. If you&#x27;d like to reach out to us, we&#x27;re available on social media, you can come talk to us after. So, thanks to Lillian, the Microsoft Edge team and everyone who created this mission for privacy on the web.</p>",

We produce a podcast called Command Line Heroes for open source developers, IT architects and sys admins. I want you to applaud if you have heard of our show. All right. A couple people. Well, today we&#x27;re gonna try something brand new. We have never done this before. We are going to do a live episode for you. Call it our beta. Or probably more like our alpha release. And we want your feedback. So, later today, we are going to be at one of the conversation corners. All right? So, at 3:00, we&#x27;re going to be at the conversation corner. And we want you to after the show come by and give us your thoughts. We want to know what you thought of the show. And you can have your caricature drawn. And we have Command Line Heroes socks to give away. Socks, right? They&#x27;re great. For those who haven&#x27;t heard the podcast, Command Line Heroes tells the epic stories of people from the command line up president we talk about the OS wars, the agile revolution, the containers, the cloud, committing and so much more. This is our third season. And it&#x27;s all about programming languages. Everything from Python to BASIC to Perl to JavaScript to COBOL and Go and C. And our most popular episode this season, can you guess what it was? COBOL. Just kidding, it wasn&#x27;t COBOL. It was JavaScript. So, by applause, how many of you work with JavaScript? I want you to cheer. Yeah? All right. Pretty good. But how much do you really know about JavaScript? So, we&#x27;re gonna test your knowledge, all right? We&#x27;re gonna test your knowledge. And we are going to do a little pop quiz up on the screen. So, for each question, I want you to applaud whichever you think is the right answer. All right? So, here&#x27;s our first question. The first release of JavaScript was created in how many days? Was it: Eight days? Nobody? Okay. Was it ten days?</p><p>[ Applause ]</p><p>Okay. How about 22 days? All right. You&#x27;ll find out the answer later. Next question. So, how many estimated JavaScript developers are there in the world today? What do you think? 3 million? Really? Anybody? All right. 22 .8 million?</p><p>[ Applause ]</p><p>All right. Some people think so. How about 10.7 million?</p><p>[ Applause ]</p><p>Hm. All right. Last question. The object oriented underlying pattern in JavaScript was taken from which programming language? Was it Modula 2? One person thinks that. Cool. ALGOL. Or Pascal? A couple people. Okay. Cool. All right. So, the answers to all of these questions are about to be revealed in the show. So, pay attention. We&#x27;re about to go deep into the language that most of you engage we&#x27;ve day. So, presenting a live performance of Command Line Heroes 3, episode 3, creating JavaScript.</p><p>\u00b6\ufffd \u00b6</p><p>[ding!]</p><p>[Motor sounds]</p><p>This is season three of Command Line Heroes. Episode 3: Creating JavaScript.</p><p>&gt;&gt; All right. So, I mentioned this before. But we are going to be recording this episode right here right now. So, actually our sound engineer, Sean Cole over here\u00a0 is going to be recording the episode. And he needs your help. So, we want to hear all of you in the episode. And when we need you to applaud, Sean is going to do this... there you go.</p><p>[ Applause ]</p><p>Let&#x27;s try it one more time.</p><p>[ Applause ]</p><p>There we go. All right. On with the show. So, presenting the host of Command Line Heroes, Saron Yibarek.</p><p>[ Applause ]</p><p>\u00b6\ufffd \u00b6</p><p>SARON: Brendan Eich was 34 years old when he sat down at his desk in Netscape&#x27;s headquarters. He was about to commit himself to a massive 10 day sprint of coding. To code a new language. A whole new programming language in just ten days. It was 1995. And the world of programming languages was about to change forever.</p><p>\u00b6\ufffd \u00b6</p><p>I&#x27;m Saron Yibarek, and this is Command Line Heroes. An original podcast from Red Hat live from Amsterdam.</p><p>[ Applause ]</p><p>This season we have been exploring the promise of programming languages. How our languages shape our world of development and how they super charge our work. In this episode, we are tracking the creation of JavaScript. Maybe you&#x27;ve heard the story of Brendan Eich before. But how does something like JavaScript really get created? Sure, there was Brendan&#x27;s sprint. But there&#x27;s so much more to the story. Our tale begins in the midst of a war. A browser war. The browser wars of the 1990s may seem like history, but they were hugely consequential. On one side of the battlefield: Netscape. They had formed an alliance with Sun microsystems. On the other side, you&#x27;ve got Microsoft. Software behemoth. And the spoils they were fighting over? It was a battle to decide who would be the gatekeeper of the Internet. The stakes were huge.</p><p>&gt;&gt; The fight was over who was gonna be the main portal to going online. You have to realize that in, you know, in the early &#x27;90s, no one was really online very much.</p><p>SARON: That&#x27;s tech historian and author, Clive Thompson. Netscape realized the power of the browser was this key piece of software that people could use to get online and look at the web. So, in late 1994, they offered a direct onramp. And suddenly</p><p>&gt;&gt; Thousands and millions of people are able to use the Internet in this kind of graphical way. They&#x27;re just getting massive, massive downloads and huge amounts of press. And everyone&#x27;s basically saying, yeah, Netscape is kind of the future of this thing called the Internet.</p><p>SARON: But Microsoft? Their whole business model was packaging stuff inside Windows. They weren&#x27;t really interested in browsers. Until they were. Microsoft stuck their head out of the sand a year later and saw that the world was moving online. But there was nothing inside of Microsoft Windows that could help them get there. All of a sudden, Microsoft&#x27;s industry wide dominance doesn&#x27;t look so solid. And it&#x27;s in that moment that the browser wars begin. The moment when Microsoft wakes up to the power of the Internet and squints its eye at their new competition.</p><p>&gt;&gt; And there was a strong sense of first mover advantage. That the first company that could sort of brand themselves as the way you get online would be the winner for years and years and maybe forever. I remember how rapid the pace of development was. I mean, Netscape was putting out a new browser every couple of months. Microsoft was accustomed to developing very slowly.</p><p>SARON: To really understand how the browser wars went down, let&#x27;s invite Jeremy Keith to the stage. Jeremy is the founder of Clearleft. A design studio in Brighton, England. He&#x27;s also the author of what he likes to call, are some books on web stuff. Come and join us, Jeremy.</p><p>[ Applause ]</p><p>Welcome to the show.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me.</p><p>SARON: Okay. Let&#x27;s set the scene. I&#x27;m a developer. The web browser just came along. What was that like?</p><p>&gt;&gt; Well, initially when the web came along, the appeal to developers, programmers we would have called them back then, was in making web browsers. When Tim Berners Lee released the code for the web, everyone was making web browsers. They were in the easy days and Mosaic led the way. That went on to become Netscape. Suddenly there was an appeal not just to developers as we say now, or programmers, but to anyone. Whether you were an artist or a writer, no matter what. You could be heard.</p><p>SARON: Tell me about the appeal. What was appealing about it?</p><p>&gt;&gt; The barrier to entry was low. Yes, you had to learn this HTML stuff. But if you can learn that, the access was there. You had to have a computer and a modem and get online. But you didn&#x27;t need to know computer science in order to put something out there on to the web.</p><p>SARON: So, Microsoft came on a year later. What was it about the browser that made Microsoft say, we need to compete?</p><p>&gt;&gt; Microsoft&#x27;s history was in selling and distributing software. That used to be CD ROMs that you buy in a shot. But they realized that the potential future was that people would get their software online and if their business was selling software, they needed to get on that. Bill Gates wrote a memo saying they were falling asleep at the wheel. And they had to compete with Netscape. Their main product was free. They didn&#x27;t sell Netscape Navigator. You had Microsoft putting money into creating a piece of software that was going to be distributed for free.</p><p>SARON: We know that Microsoft&#x27;s approach to building a browser was very different than Netscape&#x27;s approach. Tell me about that.</p><p>&gt;&gt; A lot of the differences seemed to be pure spitefulness. Do things differently because they&#x27;re different. One browser would come up with a new HTML element, make something up to do something on the web, and the other would have a new HTML element to do the same thing just in order to have this competition. It seemed like they almost wanted to force developers to choose, which browser will you support? Rather than developers being in a position to support both browsers.</p><p>SARON: Thank you for your insights. You&#x27;re going sit tight and we&#x27;ll get back to you a little bit later. But for now, we&#x27;re going to get back to our story.</p><p>\u00b6\ufffd \u00b6</p><p>all that heat around the potential of life in a browser had made one thing very clear: We needed a new programming language. Something that went far beyond HTML. We needed a language tailor made for all that new web based development. We wanted a language that didn&#x27;t just survive online but thrived there. In a way, Netscape was always the underdog in that battle. But here&#x27;s the thing: Before the battle was over, they threw a beautiful hail Mary. This would become an incredible win for the whole world of programming. So, around the time that Microsoft decided to throw their hat in the ring, Netscape took a closer look at Java. Was Java going to be the language for web development? Java was this rich language. It performed just as well as C++. But it did still need to be compiled. Developers wanted something more lightweight. Something that could be interpreted instead of compiled. Something that would appeal to all those new programmers that were swarming to the web. Netscape wanted programming language to bring static web pages to life. Their dream, to work directly on the web. Wouldn&#x27;t it be great, they thought, if they could release a new lightweight language that could run inside of the browser? And wouldn&#x27;t it be great if it worked right at the same time, they released beta 2.0? There was only one hitch. That gave them exactly 10 days to create a new language. Actually, it gave one guy, Brendan Eich, 10 days he was the one tasked with pulling this off. But there was no doubt that if anybody could do it, he could. That&#x27;s because Brendan liked to create new languages for fun. Just to play around with syntax.</p><p>&gt;&gt; The key to Brendan Eich is that Brendan Eich, when he built JavaScript, had become sort of a language junky.</p><p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s Charles Severance. A professor at the University of Michigan school of Information. JavaScript was sort of created in an environment where Java was seen as the future. And so, in 1994, we thought that it was the thing that was gonna solve everything. One year later, the thing that would actually solve everything was about to appear. But it couldn&#x27;t say, hey, I&#x27;ve solved everything. Because everybody, myself included, believed in &#x27;94, &#x27;95, that we had seen the future of rock and roll. And it was the Java programming language. They had to build a language that seemed irrelevant, seemed silly, seemed meaningless. And yet was the right solution.</p><p>SARON: On November 30th, 1995, Netscape released this powerful little seed of a language inside of Navigator 2.0. Soon, 28 companies agreed to use it as an open standard language. Companies line AOL and AT&amp;T. But a lot of old pros looked down their noses at JavaScript. They thought it was just a language for newbies. A toy language. They missed its revolutionary potential.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Brendan decided he would sneak in all these super advanced concepts from languages that were not well known. Like object oriented languages. JavaScript is like a Trojan horse. It sneaked into our consciousness with the idea that it was silly and fun and easy and lightweight. But then built in from almost the beginning was a powerful, deeply, well thought out programming language that&#x27;s capable of doing literally logical anything in computer science.</p><p>SARON: But it was no toy language. It was sophisticated in all sorts of ways and drew from the languages before it.</p><p>&gt;&gt; if you look at the language, it&#x27;s inspired by the C language with the curly braces and colons. Some of the string patterns taken from the Java programming language. But the object oriented language comes from Modula 2, first class functions, which is one of the most amazing choices that made JavaScript such a powerful and extensible language, the code that makes up the language itself is also data. And the other thing that was also part of the inspiration was HyperCard. JavaScript was always running in a browser. Which meant it had a basic data context of the document object model, which is an object oriented representation of a web page. It is not like a traditional programming language. The JavaScript code didn&#x27;t start at the beginning. The first thing that it was a web page. And so, it ended up with this event oriented programming.</p><p>SARON: The result was a language native to the browser. It could evolve as our online lives evolved. It didn&#x27;t take long before JavaScript became the defacto option for web development.</p><p>&gt;&gt; JavaScript was a language that I had no choice but to learn. And literally people that learned JavaScript usually have no choice. Because they&#x27;re like, I want to build a browser application and I want it to have interactive elements. And the answer is, therefore, you must learn JavaScript. If you imagine, like, what\u2019s your favorite language? The answer to that question has almost got to be X plus JavaScript, right? Someone might say, I like Python, &amp; JavaScript. Or, I like Scala and JavaScript. Because it&#x27;s the one language everyone is required to learn.</p><p>SARON: Netscape came out the gate incredibly strong. And they fought hard during the browser wars. But in the end, Netscape Navigator disappeared as a serious product. Microsoft was just too dominant. Windows was the default software package on 80 90% of computers on the planet. Explorer got bundled into all of that. Despite being a year late to the browser game, the all powerful Microsoft won the day. Yet, Netscape&#x27;s hail Mary, the creation of JavaScript, was a success. Because long after the fight was over, this language would have an afterlife that changed everything. Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re relatively now web development. You might take for granted that you can develop interactive web pages that can change and update. And you don&#x27;t need to pull a whole new copy of the page from the server. And imagine for a second what it was like before you could do that. When doing that was brand new. Michael Clayton is a software engineer at Red Hat. We asked him to help us understand what a huge shift that was.</p><p>&gt;&gt; In, I want to say 2004, Google Mail was released. Gmail. And it was, to my knowledge, the first web application that really took JavaScript to the next level. That used it to dynamically switch content out that you were looking at.</p><p>SARON: Say you&#x27;re looking at your inbox and you click on an email. In the old days, your email viewer would load a whole new page in your browser. Just to show you the email. Then you close that email and it would reload the whole inbox.</p><p>&gt;&gt; It created a lot of latency. There was a lot of waiting when you would switch back and forth between views. And\u00a0Gmail changed all of that. They used JavaScript to, in the background, fetch the content that you wanted to view and just put it in front of you without you having to wait for a brand new page view.</p><p>SARON: Imagine how much time and energy you saved. But it changed more than just the speed. It changed the very nature of our work.</p><p>&gt;&gt; So, web developer as a job title has gone from being a server side, kind of behind the scenes role, to being just a very thin layer away from the user since they&#x27;re writing code directly in the browser that the user is viewing the web page through.</p><p>SARON: JavaScript pretty much ushered in the web 2.0 revolution. Anyone with a web browser suddenly had a development environment right in front of them. But, as I mentioned before, the old guard wasn&#x27;t having any of it. They didn&#x27;t like how things were getting so democratic.</p><p>&gt;&gt; That early antagonism of JavaScript, I was part of that myself. I had the browser extensions that would prevent JavaScript from running. I thought it was a useless toy language. And I kind of had this feeling of anger whenever I went to a web page that had JavaScript required for some critical feature of the site. I was like, you should build your website the right way without JavaScript.</p><p>SARON: Soon enough, though, the potential that Brendan Eich built into his 10 day language became obvious to everyone. And now, it&#x27;s conquering not just the browser, but the server too. With Node.js, a whole new territory for that little language that could opened up. First in the browser. And then on servers. JavaScript was this unpretentious secretly elegant, sometimes buggy, language. A survivor from the browser wars that everybody underestimated.</p><p>&gt;&gt; JavaScript has been kind of a Cinderella story of programming languages. Starting in that early state of being essentially whipped together in step days. Going through a lot of derision from the rest of the programming community, and still somehow continuing to find success and growth. JavaScript is essentially everywhere. The ability to run inside of a web page meant that JavaScript was as pervasive as the web is. Which is quite pervasive.</p><p>SARON: The more you look at the way JavaScript runs today, the more you realize, it&#x27;s got its fingers in every part of our online life. JavaScript rode the coat tails of the web to a kind of language domination. And with any kind of domination, it got big. And bloated. It became something that powered entire applications. Even before you wanted it to. Nuisance things like pop up ads and tracking. JavaScript became all consuming. The language famous for being so lightweight now takes up a lot of space and energy. And for that, let&#x27;s talk to Jeremy. Hi, Jeremy.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Hi, Saron.</p><p>SARON: We can basically agree that JavaScript has eaten the world. How do you feel about this?</p><p>&gt;&gt; On the one hand, it is a very feel good Cinderella story. But on the other, Cinderella may have morphed into a wicked stepmother that&#x27;s crushed other languages under its heel like CSS. They are great at what they do, just like JavaScript is great at what it does. Programmers are looking at it like a hammer and it&#x27;s a nail.</p><p>SARON: Where does JavaScript sit in the toolbox?</p><p>&gt;&gt; I see it as part of the three layered part of building on the web, CSS for the styling and JavaScript for the behavior. But JavaScript is so powerful that it you want, you can use it to create, you know, a document object model effectively not needing any HTML. You can write styles in JavaScript effectively not needing any CSS. So, if you want, you can just use JavaScript to do everything. But should you?</p><p>SARON: So, you mentioned HTML and CSS. Are there other programming languages that we should think about when it comes to the web?</p><p>&gt;&gt; When it comes to programming in the web browser, no. JavaScript is. You kind of don&#x27;t have a choice. There have been some attempts to try and create alternatives to JavaScript in the web browse their never really worked out. However, you still have your web server. And you can use anything you want there. You can even use JavaScript there now, which is great. But it&#x27;s up to you, if you want Ruby, Python, Perl, whatever you want. You can put a lot of the computation back on the server and do things with pretty much any language there.</p><p>SARON: So, in an earlier episode, we talked about Perl. And how Perl has grown and evolved and kind of settled. With JavaScript, where are we? Matured or has a lot to grow?</p><p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s the opposite story with JavaScript. It was made knowing its place, in the web browser. Interacting with web pages. But since then, it&#x27;s gone on to new territories like servers and Node. And it&#x27;s spreading and you can find it more and more places. It&#x27;s grown. The evolution of the language itself, it&#x27;s got more and more powerful features. Which on the one hand is great. The people who used to look down their nose at this toy language, it&#x27;s got more features. The lower barrier to entry that was the toy language, that&#x27;s raised, which is a bit of a shame.</p><p>SARON: Not that long ago, you could block JavaScript when using the browser, it was not a big deal. Maybe a little inconvenient, but not a big deal. Nowadays, if you try to block JavaScript, you are going to have a tough time. It seems we&#x27;re dependent on JavaScript when it comes to using the web. Is that a bad thing?</p><p>&gt;&gt; Frankly, yes. There&#x27;s a lot of things JavaScript is being used for that you need to use JavaScript for, fine. The more heavy application like things, sure. But JavaScript is being used to do things that you could use HTML for. Rendering text on the screen. Some have experimented with turning off JavaScript and browsing the web and documenting findings. And there are things you can do. The web sites don&#x27;t pay attention to resilience. And at least accomplish the core functionality without JavaScript. Which is heartening.</p><p>SARON: Thanks so much, Jeremy. We have one more question for you so sit tight.</p><p>\u00b6\ufffd \u00b6</p><p>We can thank JavaScript for Google Docs, for YouTube, for Netflix. And it&#x27;s pushed along by a huge number of open source libraries. Slash data&#x27;s most recent estimate of the number of JavaScript developers in the world is 10.7 million. Over at GitHub, JavaScript has more pull requests than any other language. Power lies with the whole world of Command Line Heroes helping JavaScript grow. Like all of you out there. Jeremy, given all of that, when you think about the future of the web and the future of JavaScript, what is that future look like? What do you hope for?</p><p>&gt;&gt; Moderation is what I hope for. I think we&#x27;ve gone a bit crazy with JavaScript. And I would love to see people treat JavaScript as the powerful tool it is, but as part of a toolbox of other equally powerful languages like HTML and CSS.</p><p>SARON: Thank you. It&#x27;s worth taking a step back and remembering here: Just a couple decades ago in 1995, Brendan Eich was sitting in a room hammering out a new language. And today, that language permeates everything we do. It might sound a bit cliche, to say that some new string of code is going to change the world, but it does happen. A command line hero marshals all of their love for languages into a 10 day sprint. And the world&#x27;s DNA is changed forever.</p><p>\u00b6\ufffd \u00b6</p><p>command line heroes is an original podcast from Red Hat. Tomorrow we publish the sea change, it&#x27;s all about sea. If you haven&#x27;t subscribed yet, now is your chance. And we are hard at work producing season four right now. Thank you so much to our guest, Jeremy Keith.</p><p>[ Applause ]</p><p>And our sound designer, Sean Cole. And to all of you for joining us today. I&#x27;m Saron Yibarek.

		"transcript": "<p></p><p>Hey, everybody. So, let me just introduce myself. I&#x27;m Mike Taylor, I&#x27;m the lead graphic designer for Mozilla. And I have an air conditioner, which is useful. So, clicker, okay. I want to be really clear. During my talk today, I don&#x27;t officially speak for DevRel. More of a Rudy Giuliani shadow situation. I&#x27;m going to say some things, and if they&#x27;re true, that&#x27;s great. If they&#x27;re not true, then they&#x27;re my opinion.</p><p>So, just a little bit about me. I work for Mozilla. I worked a little bit with standards in web compatibility. I helped with a website called webcompat.com. We&#x27;ll talk about later maybe. Where you can go and, like, report broken websites.</p><p>All right. What we&#x27;re gonna talk about today. I&#x27;m gonna talk a really quick little introductory history into browser engines. We&#x27;re going to talk about a more recent history. And then I&#x27;m gonna tell you why\u00a0or I will convince you why I am right about how diversity is good.</p><p>And so, to set the stage here, 1993 razor hands, if you were alive. That&#x27;s pretty good. That&#x27;s pretty good. So, like, then really what grounded me when I was preparing this, 1993 was the year that Tim Berners Lee open sourced the World Wide Web or Nexus web browser source. It had been in development. This was like the first web browser. It had been in development for a few years. But this was when it was unleashed. 1993, Ace of Bass, I saw the sign. That&#x27;s what grounded me. What helped me connect with the web. It&#x27;s a really good song.</p><p>1993 is also when Mosaic became a thing. This was a research project that eventually turned into a commercial thing. So, that&#x27;s the Mosaic logo. That&#x27;s\u00a0that browser engine was licensed by Microsoft. It turned into the first version of IE. The Mosaic people went and started their own company and rewrote Mosaic effectively and it turned into Netscape.</p><p>So, we&#x27;re gonna look at the growth of early browser engines. So, Netscape existed. It was massive. Mosaic got tiny, IE got big. This was the very first browser war situation where we&#x27;re talk about that later. What that means. Anyone recognize this thing on the left? Raise your hand. This was Conqueror, this was the very first open source webkit ish thing. It turned into Safari. Kind of. Here is a history lesson in this aside. So, KHTML, if you have looked as the string of a Chrome browser or a lot of other browsers. It will say KHTML, like Gecko. It came from the w library, the KDE HTML widget. Which comes from kool desktop environment HTML, all right? So, KHTML, you have to pronounce it kool HTML. Raise your hand if you already knew that? That&#x27;s weird.</p><p>It&#x27;s like, hard core Linux nerds. A few over there. None over there. Okay. So, okay. Another interesting fact, which is also slightly weird, is this is a photo view of 98Waldemar in Norway, there were two companies. One was Troll Tech which made Cute and KDE and Conqueror. Also, on the fourth floor was Opera software. They developed their own rendering engine, known as Presto. You had off the same building flow two influential web browser engines. It&#x27;s kind of mysterious. I think they shared a lunchroom. It&#x27;s like if you take the door on the left, you go open source. If\u00a0you take the door on the right, you don&#x27;t.</p><p>So, the Netscape folks, they eventually started working on this open source browser called Phoenix. Before they found out that it was like there was a trademark or a copyright. And so, they renamed that thing into Firefox. This is how we got Gecko. This is not the Wizard of Oz\u00a0 no, this is the Wizard of Oz. I&#x27;m setting the stage. This is in the early days, before like two years ago, there were five rendering engines that were really important.</p><p>And we&#x27;re gonna look and see. We&#x27;re gonna see how these five browser rendering engines behaved at this point.</p><p>So, you can start to see Firefox is a thing. It&#x27;s growing. Safari starts to become a thing, Opera&#x27;s a thing. Chrome happens in 2009. And really takes off, right? Like 2011 was a huge year for Chrome. And I was curious what happened here.</p><p>So, 2011, big year. Does anyone remember watching the season finale of Saturday Night Live in 2011? There was a Google Chrome Lady Gaga commercial which she was also the musical performer. So, that was really interesting. Also, that same year, there was a really influential Justin Beiber Google Chrome commercial. And so, I&#x27;m convinced that Lady Gaga and Justin Beiber are responsible for Chrome&#x27;s success. Which is important later on.</p><p>Okay. So, now that we&#x27;ve got that out of the way, like some bad stuff happens after this point in history. It gets a little dark, so Chrome is really taking off. Really, really growing. At everyone else&#x27;s expense. And then we\u00a0so, effectively, that&#x27;s where we are up until pretty recently. So, this guy, Bruce Lawson, he had the privilege, I&#x27;ll pose. I&#x27;ll wait for a photo. He was the guy who got to write the following article, right? 300 million users and move to WebKit. I used to work at Opera, full disclosure. We found it wasn&#x27;t going to keep maintaining Presto. Too many websites didn&#x27;t test in Opera. Raise your hand if you ever tested in Opera? Okay. You&#x27;re a pretty unique set of individuals here, right?</p><p>Where I live in the United States, most people said, Opera? What&#x27;s that? It was different in didn&#x27;t locales. Site reliability was too much of a burden. We made a switch to WebKit. And a week or two later Google decided to fork from WebKit. We didn&#x27;t go back and update the blog post. But we switched to Blink. I don&#x27;t think we actually did anything with WebKit. Just to read that quote, consumers will initially notice better site compatibility, especially with user facing sites, many of which were only tested in browsers. And then there was an article by a Microsoft guy that I don&#x27;t know. But he&#x27;s got cool hair. Like Microsoft people like that joke.</p><p>So, Mr.\u00a0VP Joe, he&#x27;s writing for the same reason. Like, we can&#x27;t keep up EdgeHTML. It&#x27;s too costly, it&#x27;s too expensive. We&#x27;re announcing we intend to adopt Chromium to create better web compatibility for our customers and less fragmentation of the web for all developers. Which, again, that&#x27;s two engines which were toast at this point, right? Interestingly, two closed source browsers were unable to keep up. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s like a lesson. But it&#x27;s just a fact.</p><p>And I&#x27;ll let everyone read this. And then contemplate if it&#x27;s a good joke or not. It turns out we&#x27;re using Chrome in this browser, so this doesn&#x27;t make any sense. And so, we&#x27;re already starting to see some of the effects that have, right? Of other people moving to Chromium or Blink. We don&#x27;t have to test in other browsers now. Which is weird. So, here is the modern scene, right? We have three of the main rendering engines left. WebKit and Blink are different enough now that I would consider them separate, right? They&#x27;re related. But they implement different APIs. Different level of support for certain things.</p><p>And then there&#x27;s lots of little Chromium friends. Chromium based browsers. So, often a question you get when you start thinking about is why don&#x27;t we all just use Blink? Or why don&#x27;t we all just use Gecko, radio I thought? Monoculture is only bad if it&#x27;s not my culture is my conclusion. That&#x27;s not true. So, realistically, though, raise your hand if it&#x27;s ever been a pain in the butt for you to fix a bug in a different browser. Where you&#x27;re like, I got all my stuff working. And then I opened it in whatever browser. And you&#x27;re like,I have to rewrite this, implement some hacks. It really slows you down and it peoples frustrating, right? Like, raise your hand if you&#x27;ve ever thought as you&#x27;re going through this pain, you&#x27;re like, you know what? This is good for me. This is good for the long term web. These are the special people. And I want to hire all three of you.</p><p>Like, what I&#x27;m gonna hopefully argue in the next three minutes or however long I have, is this is a good thing. And so, we&#x27;re gonna talk about a couple of examples. So, this one is interesting. I don&#x27;t know if you read mailing lists. Or follow working groups. But if you, you might know a little bit about intrinsicize, this was a WCAG were WCAG, however it&#x27;s pronounced to add an attribute to HTML to get image orientation or like not orientation, but aspect ratio right. You know, as things become responsive. And if you have an image, it&#x27;s like width 100%, and change to viewport, things can get wonky.</p><p>And so, they said, we&#x27;re gonna add this attribute. And the way this would work, just look at the top line. Is you would have this, and you would say, like, this is the intrinsicize. So, this had an implementation. It was an experimental Chromium platform feature. You could have enabled it in your browser and tested it and given them feedback. But Jen Simmons and some other folks, they said, you know what? I don&#x27;t think we need to add a new attribute to HTML. We can do this with tools that already exist. And these three lines of code, 3 through 5, like if we just invent this aspect ratio property and stick it in user stylesheets which are CSS that the web page uses to render everything by default, we can get this for free.</p><p>And so, this was a pretty cool proposal. Like counter proposal. It was implemented in Gecko. We have been experimenting with it. Just recently Blink sent out an intent to implement. Yeah, this is a better idea. And so, this is an instance where when you have competition, or you have people who are competing in a friendly manner to get like to a good place, you can kind of push and pull and you can say, this\u00a0we have this idea and the other people say, well, what about this? And ultimately the web is a better place. It&#x27;s probably slowed\u00a0us down, I don&#x27;t know, six months or something. I don&#x27;t have the dates. And you still can&#x27;t use this today. Or rather, you don&#x27;t need to use this today. But when it&#x27;s implemented in all the evergreen browsers, it will still be a little bit of time. But it will be a better API and it&#x27;s one less attribute that you have to know about. And you never have to touch your markup.</p><p>Another area which is interesting is so, this is not really in the API space, but it&#x27;s privacy. Right now, if you have been following this, there will be talks about this tomorrow by Selena and others, probably. But privacy is like this really hot area for web browsers right now. We have been in Firefox doing lots of stuff with what we call enhanced tracking protection. We just announced recently that we&#x27;re going to block third party tracking cookies and crypto trackers, cryptocurrency miners, whatever their called, by default. And you can track fingerprinters if you want to enable that. Chromium has some interesting kind of proposals and counterproposals for this.</p><p>There&#x27;s a collection of APIs called privacy sandbox. It&#x27;s APIs and kind of just like general privacy framework way to think about these things. That&#x27;s slightly different. Safari also announced their intelligent tracking prevention. They have been blogging about this. Which is inspired by the Firefox stuff and they put a slightly different spin on it. But you can see how as an end user, like, we benefit from this type of competition, right? And we also have more choice.</p><p>There is a Venn Diagram of web standards. But there&#x27;s also product specific stuff. So, we may ultimately all end up designing APIs that honor the principles core to privacy and security. But you may be able to just pick and choose browsers that have different opinions and different attitudes. Here&#x27;s another area where I believe diversity is interesting and useful. So, this is an icon which represents a thing called GeckoView. I think it got a mention earlier today by Andreas Bovens. If you&#x27;ve ever developed something using WebView - has anyone used WebView here? A couple people. Might be building Android apps or building your own browsers or whatever.</p><p>The bad thing about WebView is it&#x27;s tied to the version of Android that your users are on. There&#x27;s multiple versions of Android, like a million or so, and you can&#x27;t reliably depend on certain APIs. They don&#x27;t exist in WebView. One of the core principles of GeckoView is you have a stable rendering engine that has support for all the web standards that Firefox supports. There&#x27;s not WebView Chrome parity 100%. It&#x27;s portable and predictable and you can go and build things with it. This is kind of like innovation in the web embedding space. And maybe that will inspire Chrome to come back and say, like, we&#x27;ve got\u00a0or Google, sorry\u00a0you know, we&#x27;ve got these other ideas. And that benefits users.</p><p>You can go ahead and use GeckoView to build a browser today. We have one called Firefox Preview, we&#x27;ve got Firefox Reality. There&#x27;s another browser called Puma, using the GeckoView codebase. They&#x27;re hooked up with the Coil web payment stuff. That $100 million that Dees is carrying around today. So, those are three examples you kind of have like APIs, platformy stuff, policy feature-y stuff. Just some examples of why diversity is important, I think.</p><p>And I think it&#x27;s also useful for us to consider what if we just get super cynical and look at whose creating, who is building the browser engines? And, what is driving their vision for the web? And I don&#x27;t want to get like super dark or grouchy. And so we&#x27;re gonna be positive about this. So, this is\u00a0this is like shadow Dev for a moment, right? This is the Mike Taylor view on the world. Like, what does Apple do? What drives them? They sell hardware. They have some services. And like, that&#x27;s where most of their money comes from, right? And so, they&#x27;re what motivates them like is an interesting question.</p><p>If you are at TPAC in Japan, or you like to read RSV logs or whatever Apple had a couple interesting CSS proposals in the CSS working group related to the new iPad desktop mode. Trying to solve really interesting challenges for getting a desktop browser in kind of a mobile ish form factor with text inflation, font inflation, text size adjust. I forget the details.</p><p>They&#x27;re trying to solve certain problems that Google is not trying to solve. Google doesn&#x27;t sell iPads. At its core, Google is an advertising company. Which I think is interesting to consider. Like, they have some hardware stuff. But they also have tons of as much ass. Right? Like, all the really cool web apps that I use every day are run by Google. Right? Like Google Docs. Google Wave. That one I use a lot.</p><p>Orkut, Blogger, right? Yeah, really good stuff. Yes, Google Reader, Google Inbox. All right. Sorry. So...</p><p>But like, really interesting, like, high performance web apps. Like the Gmail codebase, the web app is amazing. Google Docs is amazing. Really pushes their needs. And this is my opinion, of course. Mozilla. What do we do at Mozilla? Like, like the cynical view is like we&#x27;re a bunch of ivory tower nerds. Just like trying to make the Internet the best place possible. That&#x27;s maybe not a negative thing. I don&#x27;t know. Someone else could have a better negative answer. We&#x27;ll let Google respond.</p><p>So, we&#x27;re not trying to sell ads. We&#x27;re not trying to sell. I think we tried to sell hardware once. It didn&#x27;t really work out. And then Google went and bought the company. And it actually works now. So, that&#x27;s cool. So, like we&#x27;re all motivated by different things. And I think that&#x27;s actually really positive. Like, just because Mozilla has a proposal for a thing, or just because Apple has a proposal for a thing, does not mean it&#x27;s going to be baked into the web platform. At least it hasn&#x27;t historically, right? There&#x27;s been this common understanding of like\u00a0 at the W3C level, before something becomes like a standard, you need at least two independent implementations of a standard. Right?</p><p>And so, and hopefully more than just two. Like, if this is a model that continues, like, we really need to rely on each other. And you kind of like need to collaborate and develop things in a way that&#x27;s same for implementations. Right? Is it even possible to build this thing in Blink or Gecko? We need to think about what&#x27;s good for our users. All of us need to be concerned about privacy and security. I don&#x27;t want to get emotional. But these are scary and weird times to be alive. Just take a pause. Right? And like tear drop. You know?</p><p>There are people who, depending on which countries they&#x27;re in and which websites they&#x27;re visiting, they might go to jail. Or worse than jail. We need to keep people safe. We can&#x27;t do what one person wants to do because it fits their interests. And the other thing with this slide, with the intrinsic thing, that was version 1. If you have written code or any paper, you know that version 1 is always like, it works. But it can always be better. And so, this kind of like diverse browser engine world enables that.</p><p>And, we steal things from each other all the time. And I think that&#x27;s really positive. Let&#x27;s see. I told you you would all be convinced. And you really, like, connecting with this slide right now. So, what can you do? If\u00a0 I don&#x27;t know what the future looks like. Right? Like, Google is large. And they have a lot of market share. They also like, do really interesting things. Like, I&#x27;ve never met anyone who works on the Google Chrome team that&#x27;s a monster. That&#x27;s reassuring to me.</p><p>But I think we also need more than that, right? We don&#x27;t just need Google to not be monsters, we need other browsers to be able to grow and flourish and have a chance at working. So, some concrete steps you can do as an individual, as a developer. Has anyone ever seen this page? You probably have, right? This is, I think, document.compat mode browser table which lets you know if you&#x27;re in quirks mode or not. Reduce why that a lot. These are the MDM browser compact tables. Is your API well supported? As you&#x27;re shipping production ready code, it&#x27;s good to check this stuff out.</p><p>What will happen if N percent of my users can&#x27;t use this feature? Something to consider. And we should still open up our apps and our websites in other browsers and test them. And do people still do this? Like sometimes? Yeah? That&#x27;s good. More that have, please. Here we go.</p><p>Has anyone reported a browser bug? Okay. That&#x27;s really cool. That&#x27;s like maybe 10 people, 15 people. Anyone here ever\u00a0afraid? They thought they found a browser bug, but you&#x27;re like, it&#x27;s probably my fault. I&#x27;m not that smart. At least that many people, if not more. Does anyone here work for a browser company? Three times as many. There&#x27;s a lot of hand raising. Raise your hand as a browser engine that someone filed a bug and they were wrong, and you felt angry. Two. Okay. You&#x27;re bad people. You work for me. We&#x27;ll have a chat later. File bugs. You can file them to Bugzilla, to WebKit, or go to webcompat.com and file a bug. If it&#x27;s a real issue, my team will just do that for you. So, yeah, my final plea. I didn&#x27;t have the time to do the Photoshop work. Like the other strategy, like if that does not work, if we raise enough money to get Lady Gaga and Justin Beiber to do a Firefox commercial, like 2020 we could really turn this thing around.</p><p>So, that&#x27;s my talk. I have a web log. You can join my webring. Just send a pull request. Thank you very much.</p>",

		"transcript": "<p>DANIEL: Thank you very much to our wonderful MCs of the day. And as a manager, I&#x27;m familiar with delegation so I&#x27;m actually gonna delegate introductions to everybody on the panel. But first, just intro myself. So, I work for Samsung Internet. I&#x27;m lead developer advocacy team, and co chair something called the W3C\u00a0T AG, technical architecture group and on the Mozilla board as well.</p><p>I&#x27;m really honored to be able to be part of this event today. Just by way of introduction, or by way of setting the scene, this morning Henri talked about collaboration. And I really like that. He also talked about respect. I like to say the web is agreement. You can&#x27;t really have agreement without collaboration and respect. So, last week in Japan we had the W3C TPAC meeting. Many people who I see here\u00a0were also at TPAC. But for those of you who weren&#x27;t or don&#x27;t know what it is, it&#x27;s a big yearly multi group meeting that W3C runs which people come together from across different stakeholders including browsers, people at big companies, individual contributors, web developers, et cetera.</p><p>Everyone was there to collaborate. Kalir from MDN talked about the user needs assessment. Amongst other valuable insights, they looked at interoperability between browsers. That led to a lot of discussions about interoperability and the web and to work across browsers. And the W3C\u00a0TAG, we published the ethical web principles. Anybody heard of it? A couple of hands. One of those ethical web principles is the web is multi browser, multi device, multi OS.</p><p>Today we&#x27;re going to try to channel some of that energy, some of that collaboration, some of that passion for collaboration into today&#x27;s panel where we&#x27;re going to be talking about future of the web browser, the future\u00a0of different visions we hold and the priorities we all have. We&#x27;re gonna have a discussion up here. But we have limited time. So, think about this as the beginning of a conversation. You should come find us, find\u00a0us in the breaks, over lunch. Finish the discussions we&#x27;re going to start up here. With that, I&#x27;m gonna shut up, promise. And I&#x27;m gonna ask each of our panelists to briefly introduce themselves and tell us what they&#x27;re working on and what they&#x27;re excited about bringing to the web.</p><p>&gt;&gt; So, you might have seen me talk like a little bit ago. But I&#x27;m Melanie Richards. I&#x27;m on the Microsoft web Edge platform team. The cool thing about the web, there&#x27;s so much to explore. I was a designer and developer on developer experiences. More recently I have been working as a PM on the web platform directly working on accessibility projects such as high contrast, bringing UI automation to the open source projects. Things like that and very, very recently will be joining some of my colleagues working on privacy projects.</p><p>So, you know, I did just talk about high contrast. But I am really excited about it. So, we&#x27;ve actually wanted to standardize those techniques for a while. And moving to open source for our rendering engine has provided us an excellent excuse to get that conversation started again. Really happy to see that moving into the standards bodies.</p><p>&gt;&gt; All right. So, my name is Kenji. I&#x27;m French, It&#x27;s a long story. It explains a lot of what I have been doing. Which is, I actually live in Japan. I used to work for a very traditional Japanese company called Sharp. I was building smartphones. things that we were hoping that they will use. And then for some odd reasons I moved on to Google. And my main focus has been on loading, making things load fast. And I think for now I&#x27;m going to say that I care about making connections go gangster. That&#x27;s a better way of framing what I do.</p><p>And so, lately I have been working on web packaging and portals which are APIs that we hope that make the connection even if they&#x27;re not gangster, make them look like they are. So, that&#x27;s what I have been doing.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Hi, I&#x27;m Dees Chinniah. I&#x27;m actually South African. I&#x27;m based in London. My wife is Dutch. My kids are English and confused. And I&#x27;m generally a troublemaker. I have spent the longest time, almost two decades in dot com world, usual suspects, PayPal. And at Firefox. I left Mozilla about a year ago. But I&#x27;m still closely involved with the web. Today I&#x27;m an individual adviser for early stage startups and technology startups. But the thing that keeps me close to the web is working on a new standard called web monetization. Alongside a protocol called Interledger. And that&#x27;s hoping to make content creators better remunerator on the web as opposed to traditional methods which are add network subscriptions, taking the pay wall and sending it on.</p><p>That&#x27;s the stuff keeping me super excited. In the last ten days or so, we announced a $100 million grant. That&#x27;s a lot of zeros there. In collaboration, that word again, with creative commons and with Mozilla. And we&#x27;re hoping to bring other not for profits on board. And we will be distributing to web developers out there. Web developers are a good early audience but think a wider field.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Hi, I&#x27;m Ahmad Nassari. I&#x27;m from Toronto, Canada. Originally from Damascus, Syria. And my wife is from South Africa. There&#x27;s an irrelevant connection for you. I&#x27;m a CTO. I&#x27;m super excited about the supply chain and the sustainability of it. The thing that I&#x27;m most interested in is how do we facilitate access to developers all around the world. Topics like performance and documentation as Henri was talking about this morning are very interesting to me. And it&#x27;s a personal passion to give the developer experience youth and access for folks not just speaking English or western countries all around the world. The experiences we are all creating here are shared experiences for the rest of our colleagues all around the world and we should be able to reach out and learn from them as much as we can.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Hi, everyone. My name is Andreas Bovens. I work at Mozilla. There&#x27;s actually talking about connections. I used to live in Japan for many years\u00a0and then I lived in Norway where I worked for another browser vendor. I have lived in London for two years, I work for Mozilla. I&#x27;m a platform lead. I lead a team of amazing project managers that focus on all things Gecko, it&#x27;s at the heart of Firefox. And we are work on VR browsers, things like that. So, very excited to be here.</p><p>And one of the things I&#x27;m really impassioned about and have been focusing a lot over the last two years or so is a project called GeckoView. You can think of it as the Gecko engine repackaged for use as a component in Android applications. So, if you build a browser or if you build an application that somehow needs a web engine, you can plug in GeckoView. We&#x27;re trying to make it easy to use for other folks to build browsers with. And, of course, also for ourselves. We have been rethinking our mobile products, mobile browser. And also, we have been working on a VR browser. All of those are powered by GeckoView. This is something I&#x27;m really excited about.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Hi, everyone, I&#x27;m Heejin Chung from Samsung. And I am working on Samsung Internet development for like web engine features. I have been working on browsers for about eight, nine years. All at Samsung. My life is less exciting than all of yours anyway. And so, recently we have been working on progressive web apps and web payments and it&#x27;s really important for Samsung because we produce like various devices with various OSs on them. And web is very\u00a0 I mean, the platform that we can rely on to provide interoperability and consistency to our users. So, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m most excited about right now.</p><p>For my part, I&#x27;m from the US. But I live in London. So, I have the privilege of being part of two wonderful countries.</p><p>Heejin, you mentioned progressive web apps. I think that&#x27;s one discussion prior to the panel, that&#x27;s one thing that we all really touched on. Do you want to talk about web APK a bit? Or is this something that you\u00a0have been working on.</p><p>HEEJIN: Like maybe starting from March we started supporting web APKs in our Android browser. And it lets users install PWAs as native apps on Android phones. And I think it helps increasing engagement to the web contents and lets users, like, manage their privacy settings more easily. But one unfortunate thing that we had to manage with what we had to rely on in the App Store, to make that happen. So, we only support WebAPKs on Galaxy phones with Android N and above. I hope we somehow find a way to expand that to all Android phones. And another thing we&#x27;re working on these days is trying to find a way to make more\u00a0PWAs more discoverable. Inside Samsung, we&#x27;re working with other teams to see where we can show more\u00a0 suggested more web apps to users. And, well, it&#x27;s pretty difficult because in the open web it&#x27;s, like, given that we can just link to other websites. But in stores we need consent from the author or something. And we need to get consent for, like, using their logos. So, we&#x27;re trying to figure out what the best part, what the best way is for that.</p><p>DANIEL: You mentioned web gaming to me. And web gaming seems to be another area that has similar challenges, or that&#x27;s overlapping with the progressive web app story. Can you talk about that?</p><p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think web games, HTML5 games is a good use case for progressive web apps as such. I played a big part many years ago in trying to deprecate Flash from the web. So, think back to M scripting and what&#x27;s now WebAssembly, etcetera. What strikes me is the technical challenges will catch up to native. Which is why a lot of the game developers moved to the native platforms. And we will solve things like shared array buffers and things that the gamers care about. I can see them from Poki going on about that.</p><p>But the thing that was around three or four years ago that Indie game developers asked for was discoverability and optimization. And up to today, they are not solved. And the kick back to me was something like, you talk about the web, right? You have all these great search engines. But I still can&#x27;t get my game discovered. And so, on that front, when I came away from the W3C web games workshop in Seattle a few months ago, Tom from the Chrome team is looking at discoverability for web games and working with the existing work with schema.org and those pieces.</p><p>And then on the monetization effort, web monetization, I&#x27;m working on with the team at Coil. Is something we are hoping to solve. I think Andres is here, the founder of web 13K. It was web developers trying to make a fully-fledged game under 13 kilo bytes. We introduced a new category called web monetization. And surprisingly to me, we have had over 50 entries in web monetization category. They are super interesting games. As I&#x27;m playing the games, I&#x27;m streaming money to the content developers in real time. Game developers tell me, I put my games out. I hope to make some money. Maybe in six months, I get maybe a check for 50 cents. I don&#x27;t know if that check is going come. He did this on a weekend with one of his games. And, you know, I am\u00a0 the weekend after, and it&#x27;s like, I already got money in my account. He IM&#x27;d me. The enthusiasm is there.</p><p>DANIEL: Any other thoughts around monetization?</p><p>&gt;&gt; I&#x27;m really excited to see this kind of evolve as well. Thinking about publishing. You get huge pay walls. There can be a high barrier to entry to engage with content. And so, you see that like, I don&#x27;t know, web monetization, micropayments, would make it easy to say I want to read this specific article here or here. And this could lead to better privacy preserving way was making money on the web. Today the model that we have to me, personally, feels like it&#x27;s not totally working for everybody. All this cash is flowing through like the ad business. And so, it would be really cool to find other ways to support creators on the web in ways that are open and transparent. And people, I think individuals feel really good about saying, I love your content. Here. I want to support you. So, yeah. I&#x27;m excited about this.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Creators, when they make that content, you know if they can make some money. Like, today they the only chases are an ad network or a subscription or pay wall. We have to give them more choices. Things like Patreon and Brave and the stuff we&#x27;re doing with Coil and web monetization. Start putting my choices in there.</p><p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s exciting to see a lot of innovation happening in that space as well.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, at Mozilla we also see this problem with, you know, ads everywhere and users don&#x27;t like ads. There&#x27;s all this pervasive tracking and so on. So, we have put in tracking protection. But you also see the whole model of sort of ad based or ad supported content. It&#x27;s, you know, there&#x27;s still probably a place for it. But there also seems to be room for something else. So, this partnership with Coil was already mentioned earlier. But Mozilla has also been experimenting with a partner, shepherd&#x27;s crawl, looking for alternative ways to do payments or micropayments on the web and, you know, where users sign up for sort of a subscription. And then they get access to pieces of content that otherwise would be ad supported. So, these are some of the things we&#x27;re experimenting with. But it&#x27;s also a problem Mozilla is very keen on solving or helping to solve.</p><p>&gt;&gt; One thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that\u00a0 so, the first time when I was in Japan, it was the whole iMode theory. And sure, it&#x27;s like a garden, but if you look at it, it&#x27;s made of two things. It was web like content that was a subset of HTML. I don&#x27;t see any hard JavaScript. So, it was very simple. But it worked really well in the user experience for the device that you had at the time. For the more interactive experience, it was based on Java. I think there was even hard Flash which was a big mistake in my book.</p><p>But the good thing they got going was the payment. The way people would, like, browse and discover interesting things was it&#x27;s like content or games. So, they got the discovery going on. But also, the payment. It was interpreted with your mobile connection provider. And at least in Japan it worked really well. People did pay for things. There was no\u00a0ad like, supported things. It&#x27;s not like the web is not supposed to work with new things, we can do things better. And on discovery, it&#x27;s not just for web games. We hear from partners, they care a lot about discovery, especially on mobile. Because unlike desktop and laptops, people whether they use the mobile device, they want to be entertained most of the time. It&#x27;s rare when they have something in mind, and they are going to search for it and find it. It&#x27;s like a passive experience. I think there are more things we could do there as well.</p><p>&gt;&gt; We&#x27;re trying to create something where it&#x27;s organic, right? You should continue surfing the web as you normally do and not think, I should go to this site or that site. Because you want to support content creators, this automatically happens in the background. Today that works with ourselves. With something that&#x27;s built in with the browser extensions. But hopefully working on the standard, this just becomes default and baked into the browsers. And then don&#x27;t have to think, I want to give this creator 50 cents or that article 2 cents. It&#x27;s just happening in real time.</p><p>And, you know, we&#x27;ve got people that probably a lot of you know out there in the audience, you know, whether that&#x27;s Chris Coyier over at CSS Tricks and David Walsh blog and others that are playing around and experimenting with this. I think that becomes really interesting. You&#x27;re in the thinking. You just hit a site and suddenly you&#x27;re sending a few pennies. It adds up</p><p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s interesting because in the early days of the web, when I was first doing web</p><p>&gt;&gt; You going to talk about widgets again?</p><p>&gt;&gt; Sorry no. This is way back before then.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Bruce is here. You can talk widgets with him.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Tables are new, that kind of thing. Kind of era. We, you know, we really thought like micropayments was going to be a key part of the web. And it never really happened. So, it&#x27;s interesting to see, you know, new initiatives around that. I think just to tease the privacy aspect a little bit more. It&#x27;s also we have been seeing a lot happen with innovation around privacy. And Melanie, you are doing some stuff around privacy. Maybe we can talk a little bit more about that aspect.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Awesome. Yeah, so, we&#x27;re really excited actually to see really like how much activity there is in the standards bodies today around privacy. Like so many of us coming together with an idea, here is an idea. What if we did it this way? This is an interesting batch of problems that will require all of our creativity collectively to address. I think we&#x27;re early in our journey.</p><p>Really thinking about privacy and how to address these issues on the web. First, we wanted to kind of come at. Like, before we start really deep diving in the technical solutions, we wanted to start by just understanding like what is the promise that we&#x27;re making to our users? And so, we feel like it&#x27;s gonna take a while to work through all these things. And so, we need to self police a little bit. And so, internally we&#x27;re kind of framing this as like a Hippocratic Oath. What are we promising folks? And the pillars of this oath are transparency. We want to make sure our users understand what&#x27;s happening. We want control.</p><p>So, put the users in control of, you know, any privacy preserving techniques. We want to respect the user and their choices. And we want to protect their important data. So, one of the first projects that we know we have been working on in this privacy preserving space is tracking prevention. So, we kind of have this balanced view on by default in preview versions of Microsoft Edge today that will block storage aspect from, you know, certain types of trackers.</p><p>And it will block resource requests from other trackers from allowing them to, you know, get access to your data. And then there&#x27;s also like more strict, you know, settings that you can use. So, we&#x27;re also looking at, you know, some of the new proposals that are coming out. We&#x27;re starting to work on the storage access API within the open source projects. And we&#x27;re really excited to partner with everybody on this.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ahmed, you, in our discussions, you mentioned to me something which I really\u00a0 it wasn&#x27;t on my radar. Which was like about how dependencies can sometimes impact privacy because of code modules. Is that something you can talk to?</p><p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely. As we&#x27;re heading into a world where the modern web facilitates for, you know, fast loading of modules or packages or hyperlinking to something and actually using a widget that&#x27;s embedded in your website, not that kind of widget. The modern web is all about web components, all about reuse, all about sharing. We have a developer economy where you build a widget or a component of some sort and it&#x27;s used by hundreds of thousands of people, if not billions of people if it gets notoriety. Or maybe embedded as part of a product that you are using, and others are using. The actual network, like the URL and the web around it, the model of security there doesn&#x27;t translate very well. If you&#x27;re loading things remotely and/or doing things on the fly, we talk about privacy and access controls and levels of user interaction to deal with the domain that you&#x27;re on.</p><p>But when you&#x27;re doing things externally and trying to bring in context. Maybe you&#x27;ve allowed a credit card level access for this third party, now you\u2019re on a domain that&#x27;s malicious and you have allowed that permission to transfer through. There&#x27;s all these complexity lay theirs we have to think about where we as developers are using third party tools or packages or services for that matter. It&#x27;s not enough to think and worry about our own user experience using the business logic we created, it&#x27;s when you adopt or use packages or third party content. How does that translate? A big one is using services like unpackage or others to bring in CSS. Even CSS can be maliciously used to target the website that the user is on. Thinking of that experience as a developer is a thing we don&#x27;t talk about enough.</p><p>DANIEL: Is there more browsers need to do to help protect users from those types of attacks? Is there many that we can be doing on the browser side? On looking at browsers?</p><p>&gt;&gt; I would look at my colleague who is work at other companies and ask that question.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Samsung Internet has been providing, well as ad blockers and tracking blockers. Third party tracking blockers as an extension framework for a few years until now. Earlier this year we started working on a feature called smart anti tracking that we use on device machine learning to figure out if this third party domain it trying to track you. And we&#x27;re also trying to educate users what that means to them and we recently saw that users are actually turning it on more and more. So, I&#x27;m happy to see that trend. And we hope to, like, enhance actually the machine learning part and add more features to protect the user&#x27;s security and privacy more.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. Also, in Firefox, we&#x27;re shipping tracking protection. In recent versions it&#x27;s turned on by default, actually. So, we block a number of trackers. And also, cryptocurrency miners. Crypto\u00a0miners by default. So, the user has a choice between the default settings or the strict settings which also block fingerprinters. So, we&#x27;re experimenting on mobile to be a little bit more aggressive. We feel there is the problem if you block, a lot\u00a0of content might break. And so, this is like a delicate balance. You have to balance site compatibility and user expectations there with providing adequate privacy protections.</p><p>And so, this balance is often tricky. We feel there&#x27;s a little bit more leeway perhaps on mobile. It is possible there to ramp up the settings a bit and provide even more protection. We also recently, or we&#x27;re working on, as Melanie also said, it&#x27;s important to show to users what is going on or what we are doing for them. So, there&#x27;s an about protections page where you can see how many trackers have been blocked. And, you know, users can actually understand what&#x27;s going on under the hood.</p><p>&gt;&gt; You mentioned a keyword, machine learning. There&#x27;s definitely a lot of opportunities there. Because the level of supply chain attacks that we see at NPM. And we have many examples where in the past we had to intervene and/or take things off. It&#x27;s different when it&#x27;s on the web, right? When it&#x27;s in your Node modules and we take things offline because they were malicious or maybe a user decided to take off their package, like the left pad incident. It doesn&#x27;t affect the users. It affects the developers relying on the tools and the packages.</p><p>But on the web, it&#x27;s already distributed. And there&#x27;s so many levels of caches. Whether it&#x27;s network level cache or the edge caching that we all have. And the distributed nature of the web doesn&#x27;t facilitate for that. But I think that&#x27;s where things like machine learning are a good opportunity for us to kind of tackle it from both ends. Even if something is detected and removed from the source, at some point, it&#x27;s distributed already. Thousand you catch it from the other side? The user&#x27;s side? Maybe that&#x27;s another level, the browser level. But it&#x27;s interesting to start thinking about the models. There&#x27;s only so much we can do to take something malicious off of our registry. As the developer, your responsibility is now removed. But how do you transfer this back to the user.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Generally, privacy is hard. Privacy and security is hard.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Yeah.</p><p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s why we get involved in it, right? If we wanted to just get around it, we could do lots of cool stuff very quickly. Even uncle Bruce, Bruce Lawson joined me a few months ago, and the first thing he did was rewrite the privacy policy 101 times. Because it is hard. It&#x27;s easy to forget about these things. As we were playing around, I think Stefan is here, that with web monetization, it even kicks in incognito mode. You can be in incognito mode and give back to content creators that you respect.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Sure. Because of the anonymous aspect. Coming back to the progress web apps story. And maybe bringing new APIs to the web, is that something we can shift to a little bit? I mean one of the interesting things thats seen is just that we&#x27;ve never been in a kind of more active time when it comes to new stuff that&#x27;s coming to the web platform, right? And I guess coming back to what I was saying earlier about TPAC a couple weeks ago. What, you know, kind of new APIs are we looking at or are we excited about, maybe? You know, who would like to start off? Kenji?</p><p>&gt;&gt; So, I think it was at TPAC. There was this API. I&#x27;m not sure about the latest name. I think it&#x27;s called something like storage boxes or storage blocks. Anyway, I think the idea is that today when you want to use cache storage for your PWA, there is no kind of like way for you as a developer to say, I&#x27;m putting a bunch of data here. But it&#x27;s totally optional, if you run out of storage, you can get rid of it. But this set is super important. If you want to get rid of it, maybe it&#x27;s better for you to ask me so I can tell a user what&#x27;s going on. And the reason I care about this one when we talk to users in markets like India, \u00a0a lot of users are getting online for the first time. And they can afford a very low end device. And if you look at the spec, it&#x27;s like if you&#x27;re lucky, you can get 3, 4 gigabytes of RAM. It&#x27;s pretty cheap.</p><p>The CPU is not great. And then the storage you get is like 8 gig. Obviously, you can use the micro SD slot to get more. But people don&#x27;t have a laptop, they&#x27;re managing the story. And the P WA has a great story because it can be as small as it needs to be. Except we don&#x27;t know as a browser what can we get rid of? What is for the browser, what is not. This is exciting for this particular use case.</p><p>&gt;&gt; One of the stories you told me, Ahmed, about your first experience on the Internet resonates with that.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Sure. Comes back to a lot of the topics we talked about already. But shared the story of my first time getting online was when I was in Syria, living in Damascus. And I had to do a long distance dialup to the country next door so I can access the Internet on a dialup connection because it was illegal where I was from and at the time. And I had to do it in the middle of the night, you know, behind closed doors. Because if they arrest you, you&#x27;re going to go to jail.</p><p>So, dialup Internet, long distance, hand me down laptop from my cousins in the US who came to visit. That&#x27;s how I got online. Even though that&#x27;s shifted and changed, develops countries, portable or otherwise. Back there, it&#x27;s not so much the browser and what you block, it&#x27;s about your ISP tracking you and your government wants to know everything you&#x27;re doing. Or monetization is important, credit cards are not a thing. People do money transfers through cell phone and SMS communication.</p><p>When we talk about these opportunities and the things, we&#x27;re developing the web platform for, we&#x27;re leaving a big portion of humanity and people behind. But over time, they&#x27;re the ones catching up. We&#x27;re not going in and leaning in and helping be where they are. To your point, whether it&#x27;s new APIs to the platform to better detect and adapt to the environment or creating opportunities where none exist. Like performance is a big thing and a thing that I carried with me over the years. Even though I live in Toronto, if a website doesn&#x27;t load fast, I&#x27;m not going to use it. If I didn&#x27;t get it done, the cops were going to come. I needed to get online and get out. That&#x27;s good for everybody. Performance is a key differentiator. But especially for developing countries.</p><p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s interesting when Twitter launched their Twitter lite progressive web app. I use that for all Twitter stuff. They launched it as Twitter Lite with specific features that address developing countries and low bandwidth needs. Yeah.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Maybe something about progressive web apps in Firefox as well, we&#x27;re currently building a new Firefox browser for Android. It&#x27;s currently called Firefox Preview. That&#x27;s not the name. Eventually it will replace the current Firefox in the App Store. We have the luxury there to re implement everything. We&#x27;re thinking of how to implement progressive web apps and bringing it back to the browser in the early versions out now. It&#x27;s not supported now. But manifest support and installation support is coming soon. Push notifications as well. They&#x27;re landing soon. We&#x27;re looking at doing something with badging. Kind of surfacing to the user that something is installable without getting too much in their way. Because we see that users do find it more comfortable sometimes to or they feel more confident that the progressive web app is what they need. Rather than the native app. They don&#x27;t need all the bells and whistles of the native app. They&#x27;re fine, as you say, with the sort of slimmed down experience.</p><p>The faster experience, or the experience where they can control the permissions. The browser has my back, and I don&#x27;t have to give away all my private data or whatever. All kinds of permissions. And that native apps have. And so, I can better control the experience.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I like that. The browser has my back. That could be a good</p><p>&gt;&gt; Exactly. It&#x27;s a user agent, right? You have to act on the, you know, on the user&#x27;s behalf.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I like that spin.</p><p>&gt;&gt; You mentioned notifications. Which brings to mind the topic of permissions. We have a few more minutes left. Do we want to talk about permissions notifications?</p><p>&gt;&gt; I can say something about that. So,we&#x27;ve seen that, as you&#x27;ve all seen. Let me go back three years ago</p><p>&gt;&gt; Not too long. We want to hear from the panel.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I was talking about progressive web apps. And notifications were new. You can reach users and they don&#x27;t have to subscribe to the mailing list. You can send push notifications. On the mobile web, you&#x27;re bombarded with requests to please accept our publishers. We are bringing in more controls to limit this to allow users to turn off requests for publishers. Or to do it in a more subtle way so you don&#x27;t have to deal with a pop up. But users see something happening. A soft wiggle of an icon or something like that. Sort of say, hey, this site wants to send you publishers. But please continue browsing. Yeah.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Do you</p><p>&gt;&gt; So, it&#x27;s always difficult to inform users. But not annoy them. So, I think a lot of designers in our team are also, like, trying to figure out what&#x27;s the best way to do that.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I think that&#x27;s why user control is like a very important tenant. Because, you know, every person will have different preferences about like when they want to be notified, how they want to be notified and what kind of information they want. There&#x27;s two main problems. Which is like permission fatigue. You see these things everywhere. And also, the lifetime of a permission. Just because I am fine with you having this permission now while I&#x27;m like trying to get this very specific thing done, doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m okay with you having it two weeks from now. Those are two very important things to think through. Can we extend the APIs to kind of have the user control, you know, time limits for these permissions? Okay. You can have this for an hour so I can get in and out of this experience. Or you can have this for a week because I come here every day. I think that will be interesting. And I like the idea of paring back the UI in certain cases. It&#x27;s there. The user can know they have something going on, but it&#x27;s not right in their face. I think that&#x27;s a really cool experiment.</p><p>&gt;&gt; To expand on that, at some point we are hoping by having this like UX more in your face like a model that will not do it. But keep doing it. And so, I think there is some incentive problem on the web where you can get away with, like, an experience. Like, there is nothing, like, user would just keep coming back because maybe they would search for something, and you get on the search page and forget about the user experience they got last time. And I think there is a set of things we could do better here. Trying to incentivize, there are developers who really care about it. And only prompt when it&#x27;s needed. We should look at the user experience and find ways to get more of those on the web.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. I think by default limiting the sort of\u00a0making sure that the user doesn&#x27;t give away too much. As you say, like, you know, an expiry after certain time. Or just default to once. And make an effort to allow notifications to come through permanently or something like this is</p><p>&gt;&gt; I think also we&#x27;ve seen a lot of examples of websites, malicious websites\u00a0gaming the user experience or socially manipulating the user. What was the one I saw recently? There was a graphic of some friendly looking cartoon character pushing up towards the notification prompt saying, prove you&#x27;re not a robot by clicking okay. Diabolical. Absolutely diabolical manipulation of the user because users are used to prove you&#x27;re not a robot things. They don&#x27;t see them anymore. It&#x27;s something I think we need to pay attention to. In the last three minutes, maybe we want to kind of let&#x27;s go down the row, you know, like, what&#x27;s the, I don&#x27;t know. What do you want to fix on the web? What&#x27;s the web we want kind of, you know, closing statement?</p><p>&gt;&gt; Oh, gosh. That&#x27;s a tall order.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I know.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Well...</p><p>&gt;&gt; Doesn&#x27;t need to be everything. But just one thing.</p><p>&gt;&gt; You know, so, I think\u00a0 I feel very lucky to have been able to work on like the intersection of technology and human rights on the web. Accessibility, privacy. These are fundamental things that we should all enjoy and not have to give up. And so, you know, as we kind of head into thinking more about like how can we preserve privacy on the web. Thing like one really interesting question is, what do we do about fingerprinting. So, there&#x27;s cool APIs that allow us to do cool stuff on the web. But also allow you to covertly pretty a profile of a person and track them without you knowing. Blocking cookies or something. I think figuring out that is going to be very interesting and I&#x27;m looking forward to openly collaborating and standards with the rest of the folks.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Kenji?</p><p>&gt;&gt; For me, it&#x27;s mostly about the fear of discovery issue that people have been mentioning. I think there&#x27;s a lot of opportunity for us to rework the great user experience. Getting users to discover what is good about the web. More work on that. Especially trying to close the gap that we have, I feel, between what sort of user experience you can get from a native app in terms of like discovery, and what you get on the web today where it&#x27;s still hard work and you can feel that it&#x27;s still very much like a page driven user experience. You can see single loading. And the web has like this breadth of content. If we can make it seamless, end to end, people would experience what the web has to offer over the native that people use today.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I&#x27;m going to be slightly selfish and say, let&#x27;s fix monetization on the web. Have a go at it. Many people have tried many times before. You know, we have this opportunity now. You&#x27;re all content creators out there. So, I would encourage you to check out the web monetization work. It&#x27;s a simple meta tag that you can insert in your URLs. We have this thing to incentivize you, ground for the web. It&#x27;s $100 million. It&#x27;s pocket change compared to what the Amazons and the Netflixs of the world spend on their ecosystem. But it&#x27;s a starting point to catalyze the web monetized web and content that can be monetized on the web. Go out and do it. And I think it&#x27;s going to be interesting times.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Okay.</p><p>&gt;&gt; My one thing I want to see for the web is a more inclusive web for all developers all around the world that, you know, I think we&#x27;re missing a lot of experiences that we are definitely aware of. But are not being represented in these kind of conversations, in these kind of dialogues. Whether it&#x27;s standards or APIs or, you know, better behaviors. I would like to see us reach out. That doesn&#x27;t always mean the other side of the world. There&#x27;s a lot of underrepresented points of view and/or interactions from developer communities who are part of big enterprise businesses or follows who do not go out to conferences or are not part of a community. I want to see more that have representation and learn from it as much as share back to them.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Okay.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Yes. From my side, I think right now when you browse the mobile web, you see a lot of broken things. They don&#x27;t look visually very pleasing. There&#x27;s too many pop ups, too many prompts. I want to see that fixed while also still, you know, the whole privacy\u00a0aspect. Preserving some way\u00a0ties into monetization as well. Providing a privacy preserving way of making money. And making it all visually pleasing. That is sort of my you know my whole.</p><p>&gt;&gt; So, for me, I think well, as Kenji mentioned, there are some people that only have web apps as their option. So, I am looking forward to making web app more usable like native apps</p><p>And also, Melanie&#x27;s talk before this panel was very interesting because, as a browser developer, sometimes difficult to balance between the user&#x27;s needs and the content developer&#x27;s intents. So, like, we valleys a high contrast mode built in our engine. But it sometimes breaks websites. So, making these standards is really what we should work together on in the future.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Great way to close up. Thank you very much, everybody. Okay. We&#x27;re all keen to get to lunch. We&#x27;re two minutes over. I really want to ask you all to thank our members of our panel today. And thank you all.</p>",

		"transcript": "<p>PAUL: All right. So, let&#x27;s do this. Hi. I&#x27;m Paul. I&#x27;m a software engineer. I work on, yeah, web performance tools. Yeah.</p><p>ELIZABETH: I&#x27;m Elizabeth Sweeney. And thank you for the Elizabeth. And I work on web developer insights products as a product manager.</p><p>PAUL: All right. So, we&#x27;re not here just to talk about best practices for the sake of it. Performance matters because fast sites are profitable sites. But at the same time, we know it can be difficult to know where to start. And there&#x27;s a lot of things that can torpedo your ability to make sites fast.</p><p>ELIZABETH: And that&#x27;s why we came up with a blueprint for your team&#x27;s performance success.</p><p>PAUL: All right. So, let&#x27;s look at blueprint. It&#x27;s like\u00a0we&#x27;re building a house. A house of a very mature kind of performance focused team. So, we&#x27;re gonna split this into three sections of defining this blueprint. And in this these three sections are 15 recommended actions. We start from the basics. We scale up to what is considered a very mature performance culture.</p><p>ELIZABETH: So, let&#x27;s make sure we are on an even footing. These are the table stakes of performance. The things everybody should feel comfortable with as a baseline. And as we said, the previous presentation was fabulous to set this up. We want to do this starting with just the current status of the page. Are we doing well? Are we doing poorly? And you can get it with a snapshot using the PageSpeed Insights web app. And you can run it through the tool, and you can get the lab necessary to benchmark the speed. I want to break down the components of this report.</p><p>First, you see the score page at the top. This is a high level indication of how your page is doing. It&#x27;s the same score you would find in Lighthouse. It&#x27;s calculated with weighted performance metrics that Lighthouse. Measures. Things like time to interactive. And what&#x27;s special about the PSI tool is that it does provide the lab and field in one place. And the field data is sourced from the Chrome user experience report, or CrUX. And the let metrics, as well as the diagnostic and the opportunities beneath it, sourced from Lighthouse. But the report is run on your servers instead of your local machine. We know it can be one of the most frustrating things, building performance measurement into critical work streams.</p><p>It&#x27;s score variance - it makes it difficult. If the feedback you&#x27;re getting from tools tends to vary unexpectedly, it&#x27;s difficult to benchmark and take action. Some are simple like runtime of the tool itself. But a lot of the problems are actually from differences in the page itself.</p><p>PAUL: All right. So, once we&#x27;ve kind of gotten this sense and benchmarked kind of how things are using PageSpeed Insights, now we can go to town and make things faster. The DevTools makes sense for this. There we can kind of work with the page in local host in my development environment and work with it. So, we have Lighthouse there. And run it under mobile emulation or not. make whatever changes.</p><p>The next thing I want to call out now that happened just like a month or two ago is now local overrides finally works alongside the audits panel. Before they didn;t. They just weren&#x27;t really talking. So, now you can go in and make changes using local overrides. Say, for instance, add in a link preload header or, you know, just delete the web fonts to see what happens and run it against with Lighthouse to take a look. If you&#x27;re not familiar with local overrides Google it. There&#x27;s probably a video from case on it. It&#x27;s so good. Just make any changes to any web page\u00a0 any production web page and the changes persist based off of the file on your file system. Super cool.</p><p>I want to point out one newer feature that&#x27;s in Lighthouse. We call it Stack Packs. So, basically this is a feature that enables Lighthouse to increase specific recommendations for your stack. So, any JavaScript frameworks or like your CMS or whatever server side platform you&#x27;re running, Lighthouse can detect those things and then we can add in additional messages that are relevant.</p><p>So, the way that we&#x27;re doing this, we&#x27;re working with the community to make sure that, like, the So, the first\u00a0you can see here. So, like WordPress.Specific advice. If you run Lighthouse with any WordPress site, you&#x27;ll be\u00a0seeing these now. There are others in development, Angular and React and Shopify. Check it out. And if you&#x27;re interested in\u00a0contributing, make sure there&#x27;s support, Google Lighthouse stack packs GitHub. There&#x27;s a repo and it&#x27;s straightforward to contribute and write one of these.</p><p>ELIZABETH: We&#x27;re on to action three. It&#x27;s great to get a snapshot of your field data in PSI. But you want to see how it&#x27;s evolved over time. As we mentioned before, the Chrome user experience report provides metrics for how real world users are seeing the site in the wild. It&#x27;s by the users and it&#x27;s anonymously from users who have opted in. The dashboard allows you to better understand how an origin performance evolves. It&#x27;s built on Data Studio and automatically syncs with the latest datasets so you can tweak things and share with your team. You&#x27;re seeing FCP, but you can look at other metrics as well as break down into proportion of device usage or network connection types.</p><p>But you need to quantify your users&#x27; experience. It takes a village of metrics to do so. Again, as we just heard. Because it isn&#x27;t just a single moment in time, there are load metrics ranging from early to late in a user&#x27;s load experience as well as interactivity, main thread, you know, across both lab and field. So, having a lab and field story to complement each other is really critical. You need to be able to debug and kind of see how things are gonna react in the real world and try to predict that. But you also need an actual pulse on how things are actually being experienced.</p><p>Across the board between lab and field, we want to make sure that we&#x27;re accurately representing that user&#x27;s experience. Our set of metrics\u00a0solves as we get better and better graphs of how to represent the experience. Paul is going to be sharing the newest ones developed.</p><p>PAUL: Yeah, I&#x27;m going to be talking about three metrics. Henri was right, we are getting into the newer, bleeding edge metrics. The first one, this is about layout stability. Now it&#x27;s kind of called layout instability. Words are hard. So, it&#x27;s measures primarily by cumulative layout shift where shift is also like representing instability. So, this captures kind of what you think. Which is the elements on the page, inside the viewport, if they move around, we&#x27;re trying to capture like how big they were and how much they moved. And really going after the situation like this where on this amazingly adorable website where you get to click on cute cats, if, for instance, you were attempting to click on a cute cat and then an annoying ad announced itself by entering into the viewport. And push the cat down. Then, you know, it&#x27;s a pain. No one likes that. Trying to turn this performance and quantify it into a number.</p><p>Yep. Largest contentful paint. LCP. So, we have three frames here. The second one is our first paint. It&#x27;s also our first contentful paint. It&#x27;s the first text that shows up, it counts as first. But page obviously not loaded there. And a lot of times as far as user perception is concerned, it&#x27;s really when the big content that&#x27;s in viewport loads in that really feels like, okay, it&#x27;s pretty much there. There are probably other pieces here and there that are coming in. But that&#x27;s the big thing that users are like, okay, I can start working with now. Largest contentful paint is after that. Looking at the largest image or largest text on the page and when it actually renders.</p><p>Just Google largest contentful paint, GitHub, there&#x27;s a really nice explainer that gets into the nitty gritty of how you define contentful, how you define largest, how web fonts play into the mix and things like that. The third metric I want to talk about is total blocking time. This is probably the newest of the three. So, I&#x27;m gonna spend a little bit of time talking about this. To get into it, we really need to talk a little bit about input and the main thread. So, to start off, let&#x27;s say we have, you know, we have a main thread and we have a page.</p><p>And I am tapping on a button. And as I tap on that button, well, a main thread, we have to run the event handler, touch start handler, click handler, that JavaScript. When that&#x27;s done, we will be able to lay out and paint. And we can see what happens on the screen. That&#x27;s the normal flow. However, let&#x27;s say that there is a task on the main thread. I see the button. I&#x27;m about to click on it. But the page is doing something. And it&#x27;s doing something for, I don&#x27;t know, 2 seconds.So, I tap. And it&#x27;s busy doing something at the same time. So, what happens? Well, we just have to wait, right? We have a single thread. We have to wait for that to finish and then just do the event handler and everything else. So, that time there, that we call input delay. The time between when the tap happened on the screen and when we started running the event handlers. That&#x27;s input delay. So, first input delay is just that time the first time it happened, the first time there was input on the page.</p><p>It&#x27;s also called queuing time. So, let&#x27;s take this idea. But for a second we&#x27;re going to remove the input entirely. And we&#x27;re just gonna look at that task. The task is just hanging out on the main thread doing bad stuff. Then so, let&#x27;s say that we&#x27;re\u00a0on this kind of time scale. We have a long task. And so, basically what we&#x27;re looking at is the longer the task is, the more kind of risk it introduces to the user experience. A task that&#x27;s, you know, 30 milliseconds, no big deal. But obviously, a 2 second task that everyone gets every single time that they load this page on their phone, there&#x27;s a good chance that when they click on buttons and try to interact with the page, they&#x27;re going to be delayed with the task. So, it introduced a lot of risk.</p><p>So, the way that we can look at this is that the first 50 milliseconds of the task are kind of like free. Good and fine. But everything after that is trouble. And so, we call this blocking time. So, we have 100 milliseconds of blocking time here. So, what we can do is we can take a full kind of timeline. These are just some tasks happening on the main thread. And if we basically consider the first 50 milliseconds free and everything past that is blocking time. Just highlight those.</p><p>So, in total we have 270 milliseconds of main thread costs. But then 60 milliseconds of that is considered blocking. So, our total blocking time actually is just all of those in between first contentful faint and TTI. And so, what we&#x27;re really trying to do here is just capture how much risk to the user experience all the long tasks on the page are introducing. You can also imagine the exact same amount of work. We can do 270 milliseconds of work. Just chunked up into tasks that are 50 milliseconds and smaller. So, it&#x27;s not necessarily about doing less work. Just doing it in smaller chunks. Of course, if we got rid of the JavaScript work at all, that would be good too. Okay. So, that covers the newer metrics. These metrics are available in different place. In the lab, obviously, we kind of have complete control over the browser, full instrumentation. We can capture a lot of these, except full index. And you can get the field support for various metrics there, and also WebPerf APIs. It&#x27;s a shorthand, an observer and entry types. I want to point out that layout shift at the bottom, those are all introduced in like the last, I don&#x27;t know, six months or eight months. They&#x27;re pretty new.</p><p>Even long tasks started shipping about a year ago. Event and layout shift actually started shipping in Chrome 77 which was just about a month ago. So, before we go any further, I want to take a brief respite and examine a taxonomy of tools. There&#x27;s a lot of stuff on the screen. Apologies for that. So, we&#x27;re talking about a few tools and they make sense? Different situations. But I just wanted to clarify. The one thing is they&#x27;re all based on the same core engine. Most lab tools are powered by Lighthouse. While the WebPerf and statistics power the field data. It&#x27;s all kind of coming from the same kinds of places.</p><p>So, we&#x27;ve captured the performance basics of our blueprint. Let&#x27;s move on to the next section. Here is the plumbing and the professor techniques of performance.</p><p>ELIZABETH: I&#x27;m going to take a pause from the regularly scheduled program. Things you don&#x27;t want to do for the speaker, one, how awesome was that explanation of a really complicated metric?</p><p>PAUL: It&#x27;s okay, it&#x27;s fine. Thank you.</p><p>ELIZABETH: He&#x27;s going to kill me later. The second thing was my speaker notes changed, and it was Pandy, the performance panda.</p><p>PAUL: Pandy the panda?</p><p>ELIZABETH: He&#x27;s there when your experience changes to make it better. I had to explain that.</p><p>Back to the regular stuff. So, we&#x27;re at the point where you actually need to make sure that you have organizational buy in to implement this blueprint that we&#x27;re talking about. And this is because ultimately there&#x27;s nothing more annoying or difficult than trying to layer performance on top of a fundamentally non performance site. But unfortunately, this can be seen very typically in how organizations design their web apps. So, performance it an afterthought. Often it only becomes a priority in the heat of an emergency. You know, users are complaining, business is losing money and panic ensues.</p><p>Performance at the end of the day is about solving business problems and understanding that to increase conversions and lower FCP are fundamentally the same conversations. Can help to get both business and engineering excited about solving problems that lend themselves towards increasing quality for the user. And ensuring that all stakeholders have the same incentives and on want same page for what results in high ROI. They can focus on what will result in overall success for the business. And underlying the foundations of any incentive structure are feedback loops. So, we want to make sure that developers are armed with the data field and lab necessary to make the correlation clear. And that&#x27;s where some of the tools can come to play.</p><p>ELIZABETH: So, what&#x27;s great is by step six, we&#x27;re comfortable with what we want to be measuring. You know what speed metrics we want to be tracking in the lab, in the field, and what tools to use to do so. But we still haven&#x27;t defined success. So, my TTI is 7 seconds. Is that good? I don&#x27;t know. Because we haven&#x27;t set goals. And this is where performance budgets come in. And you were in control and able to define what budget you want to set based on your team needs and your goals. But at the end of the day, when you&#x27;re setting kind of reasonably aggressive budgets, it really does help to set you up for success. Particularly when, you know, new features are introduced, team grows and, you know, your bandwidth gets devoured by day to day stuff pretty fast.</p><p>There are three kinds of budgets you can set, including resource acquaint, milestone or metric budgets as well as score. All of these can be effective in conjunction with one another. Lighthouse now reports your resource quantity budgets in the report UI itself so make it easier so your team can evaluate how you&#x27;re performing against the goals you set. And this is a budget of 15 kilo bytes and 50 and 35. And you can use the budget pass flag followed by the path to your budget file in order to calculate whenever a category is over budget. Not sure where to start? Check out colleague&#x27;s performance budget calculator. It gives a sense of what a default budget might be for your team based on industry and goals.</p><p>PAUL: About here is when it makes sense to bust out the profilers and go into the performance panel in this DevTools. So, just kind of two things that you do at this point. You use the panel to diagnose what&#x27;s happening in the load. That&#x27;s a lot of kind of looking at the network requests that are coming in. The main thread activity and then the paints. And what is actually showing up in want screenshots to the user. And understanding kind of the flow of those things. A lot of times you start kind of from the success of each screenshot and you&#x27;re like, okay, that&#x27;s a screenshot that I want, what happened before it and how can I make them take less time? The other thing in the performance panel is what&#x27;s happening on the main thread. Looking at the call stacks, who it is, what it is, maybe it&#x27;s from a third party. Understanding and breaking it down into what is taking up time. And often there honestly, it&#x27;s more a matter of deferring things more than like doing a micro optimization. Switching the fore loop to a while loop.</p><p>ELIZABETH: And as much as we would like to sit in front of DevTools all day running lighthouse over and over again to make sure there are no regressions, that kind of sounds fun, we need to make sure that we are automated so that we can actually scale. That&#x27;s where production monitoring comes in. There are a lot of third party production monitoring solutions built on top of Lighthouse&#x27;s engine. And as Paul mentioned, a lot of the tools are based on the same core technologies and data. And I really like that production monitoring can be done with the PageSpeed Insights API. You can run Lighthouse and track the scores over time as well as other audit categories across the board. It runs by default with just desktop and performance. But you can expand it to all categories and get CrUX field data from the API as well.</p><p>PAUL: At this point, probably need more details on the user behavior on the site itself. There&#x27;s a lot of great solutions here. I&#x27;m going to call out one. It is a Google solution. But it&#x27;s somewhat new, most people don&#x27;t know about it. And I think feature wise, it&#x27;s really nice. And so, I hope we see other solutions also provide some more things. So, Firebase has a new performance monitoring for web apps. If n there you see a bunch of key performance metrics. You don&#x27;t see coming from JavaScript analytics kind of provider. So, first paint, first contentful paint, first input delay are all there. The thing that I love about this is you get the full distribution from all your users.</p><p>The ones that were on desktop on fiber and the ones that were on a slow phone on a really poor or flakey network connection. So, you get the full distribution calling out the median two, not the average. The average is just the worst possible number to summarize and run data with. I just hate it so much. I&#x27;m just\u00a0 I keep sending emails to Google Analytics people and being like, stop doing what you&#x27;re doing. Do better things.</p><p>So, I really like this stuff. And you can also dig into specific metrics, see how they change over time. Pivot the database on different variables. Some powerful stuff\u00a0so, it&#x27;s cool. And I&#x27;m really hoping to see similar things. Like on the metric availability slide, the amount of new kind of performance signals that you can collect from the page in the page with JavaScript has really grown quite a lot in the last year. And so, it means that we can now have a much more complete picture. More than just content load and on load. But really understand what&#x27;s happening for all of our users.</p><p>ELIZABETH: So, now we&#x27;re at the point where we know how and what to collect with the field data both in aggregate as well as on the page level and how you&#x27;ve performed over time against your benchmarks. That&#x27;s great. But we kind of want to know how you&#x27;re doing in relation to your competition, hey, am I doing well? Here we recommend that you leverage the full power of CrUX, but with BigQuery to big deeper into the datasets. You can compare across the board in the industry that you play in. You can visit CrUX on GitHub for useful recipes for extracting these insights, so you don&#x27;t have to write the scripts yourself. If you have a cool recipe, please share.</p><p>PAUL: There&#x27;s a bunch of little snippets and recipes. It&#x27;s a kind of atypical. Not like a software project in itself. These are good ways and good starting queries to work with the project. Another thing that I want to call out that we don&#x27;t have a slide for is that there&#x27;s a third party API that was launched, two or three weeks ago. It&#x27;s called CrUX.run. That&#x27;s the domain. So, someone else built it. Basically, is exposing just a restful API that has the same CRUX data in it. If you want the same data in API and not to run big queries, good solution.</p><p>ELIZABETH: Now you have the foundation and the plumbing. There&#x27;s something missing because I can take a shower, but I can&#x27;t turn the lights on. So, now it&#x27;s for the stuff that will really light up your world.</p><p>PAUL: Light up your world. That&#x27;s really good.</p><p>ELIZABETH: I can&#x27;t help myself. This part of the blueprint for performance success is one of the most valuable things that you can do. Being able to correlate your speed metrics with key business indicators and you want to be able to understand and correlate the speed with which your users interact with your site, your conversion, bounce and engagement rates. It&#x27;s all kind of a gold mine. And there are a few steps to get started with this. We&#x27;re going to show two right now. The first is choosing a representative or pages to track over time between your business and performance metrics. With that in place, you can then reasonably evaluate the correlations.. And this will eventually allow you to do things like estimate the impact of a new feature on revenue prior to deployment. And quote the cost of future implementation during design itself which is invaluable.</p><p>PAUL: By now you probably noticed that all the third parties on your site are causing a lot of performance pain. So, we need to sort that out. There&#x27;s two really nice tools that I want to call out here. Request Map is really great visualization of the third parties on your page, their network costs and dependencies for this nice dependency graph. It actually just takes a web page, web page test URL, throw it to Request Map. They look at the detail and generate this visualization off it. It&#x27;s super great. If you are interested in the web scale impact of third parties, check out third party web. It summarizes the runtime cost of third parties across the web. It&#x27;s great for comparing competitors. The chat widgets in the bottom right. There&#x27;s like, you know, like 20 different companies that create that thing.</p><p>You can compare what their main thread impact is on the average web pages that they run on. So, that you can pick a low impact one. And the other cool thing is that the data is all open source. Even the mapping of domain name to entity and company is open source. And so, if you have a project where you really just want to be able to make that\u00a0or connect domain names to who it is, just check out third party web npm pack. It&#x27;s pretty cool.</p><p>Ultimately, solving? Working on and improving your third party situation requires working as a team. So, in this case, you&#x27;ll want to kind of bring together representatives from different parts of the company. You know, folks from marketing that tend to add new tags to the page that track revenue and adjust conversion. Or understand conversion. But it actually negatively impacts the conversion. But bring them together. Establish the shared goal: We want faster web pages. From that point, you can then review all the third party tacks together. Understand their impact, determine what&#x27;s required. There&#x27;s a great article about this from Gareth Club how they did this at the Telegraph. Action 13, your site is not like other sites.</p><p>You may want to define success in a way that&#x27;s custom to you. That&#x27;s cool too. For instance, on our cute cat clicking site. That&#x27;s really hard. What&#x27;s success there? Well, we want the picture of the cat just right in front of the user as fast as we can. So, we can create a custom metric for that. We can use element timing. So, element timing actually just shipped in Chrome 77. You add that attribute into your HTML on image. And then performanceObserver, the last line is the important one, observing, entry Types: Element. You will get entries for anything that you have tacked in your HTML. It represents when that thing was painted. Yeah. That&#x27;s our time to first cat thing. Yeah, element time, Chrome 77, check it out. It&#x27;s pretty nice.</p><p>ELIZABETH: And our time to end of presentation is getting close. So, I&#x27;m going move fast. You&#x27;re wanting to measure your custom KPIs, but you don&#x27;t want to build your own infrastructure. That&#x27;s where Lighthouse plugins come in. At the core, a Lighthouse plugin is a node module and checks and added to the report as a new core category. Ultimately, it&#x27;s in relationship to stack packs, it&#x27;s a complementary feature. Stack packs, you&#x27;re mapping strings and guidance to existing Lighthouse audits. With plugins you&#x27;re creating new sets of audits on your own.</p><p>PAUL: You can check out the recipe and guidance if you&#x27;re interested in this. You can basically write new audits off of anything based off of any of the data on the web page. It&#x27;s pretty powerful.</p><p>So, CI is probably the last frontier here. You want to know for each new pull request if it improves my performance. If my TTI is slower, if it&#x27;s faster. And you want to know that in development before you&#x27;ve deployed it. So, understanding performance measurement in a CI scenario is important. But up until now, it&#x27;s been really hard to have to be able to implement it. There hasn&#x27;t been a lot of good software for this. But it&#x27;s one of the most effective ways to defend against regressions. So, I&#x27;m going to skip over this. There is a great story about how the Wikipedia Dev team actually was using field data and their performance set you up using site speed to basically understand what&#x27;s happening to their first contentful paint metrics. And actually, they were able to identify a change in the implementation of FCP in Chrome. And here they&#x27;re kind of identifying, well, we switched the lab browser and it dropped and switched it back and it came back up. It was in the browser. It was not us. This led to a nice conversation. We were able to work with them to resolve it.</p><p>Having this kind of insight into your performance is a really key thing. There&#x27;s been a few things that we&#x27;ve been working on here. So, yeah. So, this is a complete tease. We&#x27;ll be talking about this a little bit more. But we&#x27;re working on a project called Lighthouse CI which is really focused on this experience of, okay. I want to run Lighthouse against my project as it&#x27;s in development. And see, okay, what is the difference? What changed? It&#x27;s on GitHub. But it&#x27;s early.</p><p>And you&#x27;ll be seeing more about this probably around November. That&#x27;s a good bet. Okay. I think that&#x27;s it. So, yeah. I think we&#x27;re done with our 15. We&#x27;re wrapping up.</p><p>ELIZABETH: \u00a0so, these are the 15 steps we have gone over that encompass the blueprint. But we can do one better and actually look at the tools associated with each step. We know it can be difficult whether to use what and where. And as Paul said earlier, everything is built on the same foundation. We hope this toolbox can be seen as everything that you need in order to implement this blueprint.</p><p>PAUL: Yep.</p><p>ELIZABETH: The links we shared for ease of reference. The slides will also be made available.</p><p>PAUL: Is that it?</p><p>ELIZABETH: Almost. The last slide is our call to action. We want the blueprint to be implemented. But do know that we are available for resources and with guidance. We want to help.</p><p>PAUL: That&#x27;s it. Thank you, guys, very much. Appreciate it.</p>",

I was here in July. Honestly the weather was the worst it was, I would be here in a heartbeat to be with you. My name is Hui, and I&#x27;m going through the CSS techniques but with the help of DevTools. I don&#x27;t know\u00a0about you, but I thought DevTools was something you invoke when things went wrong. A debugging tool. But over the past two years, Firefox DevTools has moved into that. And because I use Nightly as my browser, I experienced this firsthand as the end user.</p><p>I&#x27;m going to be covering a couple things today and I will be talking very fast. I&#x27;m sorry in advance. First thing we&#x27;re going to talk about is content based sizing. The concept of automatic sizing has always existed. Browsers have always managed to figure out how much space content should take up without any intervention from us. Content can kind of just reflow without overlapping. But there&#x27;s a relatively new specification known as the CSS extrinsic and intrinsic sizing level three, allowing us to assign automatic widths to the page. Width and height can be three more values of min content, max content and fit content. Min content is the smallest size that a box can take which doesn&#x27;t lead to overflow.</p><p>Any inline content will break multiple lines. Line breaking might be something that most of us don&#x27;t give a second thought to. But there is a lot of nuances depending on the language being used. For many languages like English or Dutch, the line breaks occur at word boundaries where spaces or punctuation are used to explicitly separate words. Browsers, by default, are not going to break words. If you look at the first box, the word content plus the full stop at the end is a single, unbreakable entity and that&#x27;s the width of that first box. But for languages that use home characters, Chinese or Japanese, the break is per character. Most of the time, but not always. Because there are rules about certain characters that are not allowed to start or end a line.</p><p>Now, East Asian scripts use something known as a full width punctuation. So, if I add a full width comma here, you notice that the box is now two characters wide. That&#x27;s the width of that box. We have some southeast Asian scripts like Bai written without scripts with words. It&#x27;s syllable and word boundaries. This is a good time to bring your attention to the max content set of examples. I only personally know one person in the audience who can read Thai. For the rest of us, if you don&#x27;t read Thai, you won&#x27;t know where it should break. But the max content is the box&#x27;s ideal size in a given axis. And continent will try to take up\u00a0the most space to lay outside in a line. In the Thai instance, this word is the longest in the sentence. Going back here, you notice for the min content, the width of the box is the width of the word. You can&#x27;t read it, but the browser knows exactly where to split the line.</p><p>Fit content is unfortunately not a supported value for width and height. But all three keywords are supported when used in the context of a grid formatting layout. So, fit content is not a fixed value like the previous two keywords. It is a range. It is a range between the min content size and the max content size or length percentage defined in the fit content function. Whichever is smaller. I&#x27;m sorry, that was a lot of words. It&#x27;s easier to\u00a0look at the code.</p><p>So, this is how it&#x27;s being demonstrated in the browser. So, as you can see, this set of three cool ups, their size min content, max content and fit content. 300 pixels respectively. So, the max content size of this run of text is about 482 pixels. Now, when I resize the browser, you&#x27;ll notice that the fit content column starts to shrink. It will shrink, keep shrinking, shrink, shrink, shrink. And hit min content. It stops there. But as it starts to grow with more space, it will stop. It will stop at 300 pixels because that&#x27;s the value that has been put into the fit content function.</p><p>Now, if we change the cap value to something a bit longer than its actual next content size, say 500. If there&#x27;s more space, it will keep growing. It will not hit 500. It will stop at the max content width. I was trying to describe that in words, very hard to understand, hopefully this is clearer.</p><p>Next thing to cover is Flexbox. Where nobody knows the exact size of everything. Hopefully after this bit, it becomes more clear. Flexbox was the first layout model that was specifically designed for building web layout. So, it was a lot more powerful than some of the previous techniques that we used to have. Basically, it allows the browser to take over sizing based on the amount of available space. Which can be confusing at first because the end result may not be what you specify as a CSS length.</p><p>As for now, Firefox is the only browser we are a Flexbox inspector for. So, we can sort of toggle this if you click on the tag in the inspector section. Or you can go to the handy layouts panel, click the pretty blue toggle here. Turn it on and off. If you don&#x27;t like green. I like green. You can change the color of the overlay. The overlay shows the outline of the flex items and any free space with this texture style thing. Additional information including the flex direction. In this case, it&#x27;s row.</p><p>Shows you the wrap status. In this case, it&#x27;s no wrap. But most importantly, it shows you what the browser does to your flex item when it resizes it. And we&#x27;ll talk about this a bit more in the examples. What I find cool about Flexbox is the distribution between the content. And there&#x27;s factors like the amount of free space available, the amount of content in the flex item and the starting width of the flex item. The algorithm is a tough example, but it&#x27;s available in the specification. And the key to understanding Flexbox is understanding how the flex basis properly works.</p><p>Say I put a value of 100 pixels as the flex spaces of a flex item. I think intuitively most people expect to see a box of a hundred pixels. Because we&#x27;re very used to being in full control of our sizing instructions. But flex basis is actually the starting point from which the size of a box it calculates. The keyword here is starting point. Because if you allow an item to grow or shrink, odds are the final size may not be 100 pixels. So, styles you may encounter a scenario where the same flexion values give you different end results visually.</p><p>So, if we look at the second set of content, I have two flex containers with three flex items each. And the first two items have exactly the same content. We just have much longer content for the second set. Both only have display flex set on the container. And nothing set on the children. So, it&#x27;s totally possible to change the different flex values on the children, but by default, they are zero, one and auto. So, a flex grow value of zero means that the items are not gonna grow beyond their starting widths.</p><p>So, in this case, there&#x27;s a lot of space. In fact, there&#x27;s extra space. But the flex almost will not grow to fill up the space because you&#x27;ve taught the browser the flex grow is zero. So, don&#x27;t grow. But with a flex shrink value of one, it means that the moment there isn&#x27;t enough space, the browser is going to start taking space away from the flex item. When I start to shrink, hit about this point, the second set of content has already started to shrink. When you hit somewhere here and look at your flex item, you notice that the second column has the same content, but it&#x27;s sized differently because the adjacent flex items impact the sizing of all the flex items within a flex container.</p><p>When the flex basis is auto, this is typically equivalent to a max content width. When there&#x27;s no explicit set on the item, both the width of the item and the flex basis is set to auto, the browser is going to use the content size as the starting point. This is reflected in the Flexbox inspector. You can see content size, 118. There&#x27;s some pixel issues here. Let&#x27;s just round up because what is math? But if there is an explicit width set on a flex item. Let&#x27;s do this. I shall highlight this. So, let&#x27;s set a random width. Let&#x27;s say 200 pixels.</p><p>So, once you set an explicit width on a flex item, that becomes the starting point. Back to the layout. You can see it&#x27;s 198 because border box. 1 pixel borders. It does map very well, FYI. But when there is an explicit flex basis value, however, and we shall set this here. Zero, one, 300. With an explicit flex basis value, even though there is a width on your flex item, the flex basis value is going to trump it and that ends up being the starting width of your flex item. You&#x27;ve realized that setting a width doesn&#x27;t give you the width that you want, maybe check the flex space&#x27;s value.</p><p>The next section I want to talk about is the difference between having a flex basis of auto, and a flex basis of zero. We have two sets of three items. But this time with exactly the same content. All the items have a flex shrink value of one. They will all shrink at the same rate when there isn&#x27;t enough space. But there is varying flex grow values. The values are one, two and zero respectively. To demonstrate how it&#x27;s added to the items when there is excessive space. Pull this out. The first is auto as the flex basis. Meaning the starting width for each item is the content width. Highlight here, check layout here.</p><p>You can see that the starting size is about 246. But the Flexbox inspector also tells you how much your flex item has grown. So, the available free space in this scenario is actually the total width of the container minus all the width of the content of the three flex items. Notice my cursor, this bit here, this bit here, that&#x27;s the amount of free space that the browser can working with. So, for the first item you see that it has grown about 136. And for the second one, it&#x27;s grown about 272. So, basically it grew double the size. But the final size of the first item is not half that of the second one. Because of the existence of the content width.</p><p>If you had wanted a scenario where your one item is exactly double of another one, you would want a flex basis of zero. If you look at the second set of content, I&#x27;m going to highlight it, when you set a flex basis of zero, the content size is negated. In the second scenario, the total amount of free space available is the total width of the container minus the min of the item, there&#x27;s no space there. And that&#x27;s up for grabs. Content size is zero. The item has grown 380 pixels. And the second one is double. About. 760. That&#x27;s the difference between zero and auto. And given the use case or the design that you&#x27;re building for, it is definitely something to keep in mind.</p><p>Another thing that&#x27;s cool about Flexbox is the ability to use the properties. The Flexbox inspector allows us to visualize how the free space is distributed. If I turn this on. So, box alignment properties were originally meant to be used across all the layout models. But for now, it only applies to Flexbox and Grid. And there are a couple of values that we can use to distribute free space in these contexts. Nice thing about DevTools is autocomplete. If you can&#x27;t remember any of the keywords, you can kind of just flip through and see channel changing, which fits you the best. The flex, the justify content property essentially allows you to adjust flex items along the main axis which is the direction that all your flex items are laid out.</p><p>So, you can kind of move your flex items within the container. You can also distribute the space between the flex items within the container. You can change the direction of flow. So, if I change the flex direction to column, can&#x27;t spell column. And give it height.</p><p>The main axis has now been flipped. So, the justify content property still applies along the main axis. It&#x27;s just now that I flipped it, it&#x27;s a vertical top to bottom instead. Across axis is perpendicular to the main axis. So, let&#x27;s turn this off first. And items are stretched along the cross axis to the full height of the flex line the moment you apply a display flex on a parent container.</p><p>So, however, if you apply any of the self alignment properties, for example, I put in align items here. The items are going to shrink back to their original heights. This behavior also applies to grid items. If you do a self alignment property on your grid container, you will have them shrink to fit the content. A very interesting value for alignments is baseline. If you have a situation like this where I have flex items of varying heights, varying positions, different positions. And the text is sort of related, you can sort of align all the baseline to make it easier to read in a way.</p><p>The last thing for Flexbox in box alignment properties is align content. So, say you have a container that is a lot taller than the height of your tallest. Using the aligned content property allows you to pack your items together and move it along the entire container if the height of your container is way longer than the height of your flex items. Next up, I can&#x27;t talk about layouts without talking about Grid. We have to talk about Grid. And regardless of whether you&#x27;ve used Grid in production or trying it out for the first time, the Grid inspector tool can help you try it out in Firefox. You can set the track sizes on your rows and columns. So, let&#x27;s look at the syntax. You apply display Grid.</p><p>And this is a syntax that I&#x27;m really fond of because it&#x27;s kind of visual. If you see three values in the columns, see three columns, and two values in the rows, you see two rows. Fine. The browse her automatically place your items into the grid using a thought through algorithm, defined in the specification. But things being placed one after another is behavior that most of us are fairly familiar with already. What&#x27;s special is how simple it is to manually place items in both dimensions. My favorite analogy is placing pieces on a chess board, it is what it is.</p><p>Here we have a fairly small 3x3 grid. And the position of the grid items in here, these three pawns, it kind of works like XY coordinates on a Cartesian plane. I would use a grid column of two. Having aligned numbers from the Grid inspector tool is very helpful. For the most part, doing a full page or complicated layout, you have upwards of 20 columns. You&#x27;re not going to sit there and count. One, two, 24 and place the grid item there. You want\u00a0to see the position and put it where it is. This is a useful aspect of the Grid inspector tool. Another thing that&#x27;s useful, another syntax I like about Grid is grid template areas. You can name why you want it to be. This syntax is nice. It&#x27;s structurally similar to what we see rendered on the page.</p><p>You can&#x27;t really see it because in DevTools it&#x27;s squished together. But in your code editor with a monospace font, you can lay it out nicely. Now, each line that is surrounded by quotes represents a grid row. While each value inside the line makes up the grid column. So, every line must have the same number of columns. Otherwise this whole thing is moot. So, you can change your layout without having to touch the code for individual grid items. You only have to modify the code on your grid container.</p><p>So, here, for example, if I think boat shouldn&#x27;t take up four grid cells, what we can do is we can just modify on the parent container here. So, and just by modifying the code on the grid template areas, I can change the size of the grid item, and I think this is very handy for let&#x27;s have a more real world example. We have something like this. You have a layout, title, content, navigation, etcetera.</p><p>When the viewport changes, I can reposition the elements to fit to build a layout that fits better given the amount of space. And instead of going to each individual grid item and adjusting the positions there, I&#x27;ll just flip it back so you can see all the code changes are isolated to the code on the grid container. And at the smallest width, I don&#x27;t need Grid anyway. So, just get rid of it. I think grid template areas are good when doing full page layouts, especially for more editorial design. And you can use the Grid inspector to see how your Grid items assigned to the respective Grid area names have been tweaked.</p><p>Another fun thing about Grid lately, this is a new feature that Firefox has been supporting since 66, I think. And it&#x27;s the ability to animate Grid rows and columns. This was always in the specification, but it took a long\u00a0 not a long time\u00a0 but some time for browsers to implement this feature. When you see something like this, intuitively you think that the grid item is moving across tracks. But that is not the case at all. And only when you inspect it using the Grid Inspector tool, things become a little clearer. Turn it on. In actual fact, this example contains a grid container of two rows and two columns with one grid item in it. And what the transition what the animation keyframes are interpolating is the different column and row sizes that I&#x27;ve said explicitly. And the grid items alignment has been set to the bottom right corner of the grid cell. It&#x27;s a faux animation across tracks. This is where the support for the new CSS feature helped in my understanding of how things worked under the hood.</p><p>Sometimes I get the question of which layout model is better, Flexbox or Grid? To me, that&#x27;s the wrong question to ask. Earlier, whether I talked about the box alignment properties, I mentioned self alignment would make the design shrink to fit. So, if we have a design like this, you have very thick black grid lines that are along\u00a0think borders along the grid lines. But your content does not necessarily fill up the entire grid cell.</p><p>So, if I say just highlight this one, for example, it is actually a grid item, but it&#x27;s a flex container. This is necessary because if I didn&#x27;t make this a flex container. Just remove this. And tried to do that effect using just box alignment properties on the grid itself. You would think you would use something like align self center, it doesn&#x27;t work at all because the content shrinks to fit.</p><p>So, it&#x27;s actually perfectly accept to believe use a combination of Grid and Flex. It&#x27;s accept to believe make a Grid item a Flex container. It&#x27;s not about Flexbox or Grid, it&#x27;s about Flexbox and Grid. And I think that&#x27;s the way a lot of CSS works. It&#x27;s about combinations of different CSS that really make the power of CSS shine through.</p><p>Now, one it last thing I want to cover is flexible sizing. I haven&#x27;t been able to think of a better name for this. But I found flexible sizing a very intriguing aspect of modern CSS layouts. Because previously we&#x27;ve always used relative units like percentages. Or even the new ones are viewport units. The issue with those is they make all of your elements change in size at the same rate. Grid introduces something known as the FR unit, the min/max on function. We have other intrinsic sizing values, fit content, auto. And with all of these, we can have something now known as variable rates of change. I&#x27;ll explain this soon.</p><p>And all these sizing units are fully supported in a Grid formatting context. So, all of these boxes, all of these examples are actually just grids. And there is a lot of browser resizing coming up. So, in case you didn&#x27;t know, the alternative talk title for this particular talk was, you mean you don&#x27;t resize your browser a thousand times a day? And so, that&#x27;s\u00a0that&#x27;s that. I&#x27;m gonna do this. And this.</p><p>So, the first thing that I want to compare is FR units versus auto. So, there&#x27;s a handy legend here. Green for FR, blue for auto. And FR represents a fraction of leftover space in the Grid container. Whenever there is any extra space, it will always go to an FR sized column. But also, the first to have taken away when there is no space. Now, auto\u00a0is kind of similar. In that it will take up as much space as necessary without breaking line. It behaves like max content, but not as rigid because it will shrink when there isn&#x27;t enough space. So, that&#x27;s how they behave individually.</p><p>But when used together, you&#x27;ll notice that auto will cap itself at the max content no matter how the viewport grows. Fair enough. When there isn&#x27;t enough space and space will get taken away from the FR column, taken away, it will continue to take away space from the FR. Meaning that the auto column will hold its max width until there&#x27;s absolutely no space before it itself starts shrinking. Of course, everyone ends up at the minimum size eventually. But in a sense, you can notice how auto is behaving differently from FR already. The next set of values that I want to compare is fit content and min/max. They behave quite similarly. They&#x27;re both a range of values with a maximum and minimum limit. The first one is the minimum size, the second is the maximum.</p><p>We have covered the content. Look at example five. When there&#x27;s not enough space, the FR column is the first to lose size. First to go. Fit content and auto\u00a0shrink and hit their minimum size at exactly the same time. Boom. That&#x27;s all nice and good.</p><p>The example six is slightly more interesting. Because that&#x27;s with min/max, auto, and then fit content. So, when the columns grow and shrink are different for all three. So, again, a lot of browser resizing. Auto\u00a0starts off with all the free space when there&#x27;s plenty of it. So, it&#x27;s also the first to give it up when the space gets taken away.</p><p>So, it&#x27;s the one that starts to shrink more. But the moment it hits its max content size, it stops shrinking. Space instead gets taken away from min/max, which is the yellow column. Space will get taken away from min/max until a random point when all three start to shrink again. I don&#x27;t know exactly when that point is. But it is the point that louse all three of these columns to hit the minimum size at exactly the same time.</p><p>So, in a growth scenario where there&#x27;s lots of space, fit content will grow, but it will get capped at its maximum size. And then after that, you&#x27;ll notice that auto\u00a0gross. Auto\u00a0will grow until it hits the max content size and then stop. The space then gets given to the min/max column before hitting the maximum size of 400 and auto continues to grow. That&#x27;s what I mean when I say there&#x27;s variable rates of size changing. Column sizes can sort of wait for each other. And I think this opens up a lot more options for editorial design that adapt well to a greater range of viewport sizes. Take this example. It&#x27;s actually two layouts that look very similar at a wide range. The first one, the top one, this is sized with percentages. And the issue is apparent when the viewport size gets smaller because everything reduces at the same rate.</p><p>At some point you&#x27;ll probably end up having to write a media query to rejig the percentages at such a small viewport. It doesn&#x27;t work well anymore. Image is too small, text is squished together. But look at the one that&#x27;s sized with variable sizing, it&#x27;s a lot more robust across a wider range of viewports. And I think that&#x27;s pretty interesting. It&#x27;s a good\u00a0 it&#x27;s a fairly good property to make use of. And in addition to that, Grid also allows us to do things like, say, overlap a lot more easily. And that also opens up a lot more interesting combinations with other, not necessarily layout related CSS, but things like modes, background, masks, to do a lot more interesting things with layout.</p><p>So, this is a very, very crude example of how to use blend modes to overlapping content for more artistic effects across different viewports. Depending how the viewport changes, the overlap is different. This is not a hackie overlap. Maybe you used negative margins and things didn&#x27;t fix. This is perfectly responsive if you ask me. CSS properties are pretty good, it&#x27;s when they&#x27;re combined together in creative ways where magic can potentially happen. CSS is evolving and becoming a lot more powerful. Many of the order tricks like nested HTML tables, they are not necessary anymore.</p><p>But with layout properties that were specifically designed to suit the dynamic nature of the web, there are now concepts to be learned. And I realized that DevTools can be an avenue to encourage developers to start trying out new CSS features by providing guidance as part of the debugging process. Flexbox clicked for me when I saw the browser looked at the size of the items. And I was able to look at complicated designs with names and line numbers, supporting of multiple grid overlays. Even new details, line positioning line number tags at the edge of windows. Shipping new features with corresponding DevTools support is one of my favorite things about Firefox DevTools. I want like to end by saying if you have been on the fence about trying out the new features because they seem complicated and hard. Just do it. It&#x27;s not as scary as you think.</p><p>Thank you very much.</p>",

		"transcript": "<p>Thank you. Awesome. Hello, everyone. I&#x27;m really excited to be here. And really excited to speak to you all about performance, which has come up quite a bit today. And it&#x27;s exciting to be with a bunch of other people who are excited about performance. And specifically, what I want to talk to you all about is how specifically I got interested in web performance and how I have gone about trying to answer almost impossible questions, like, is the site fast yet? And maybe together we can get an answer for that.</p><p>And so, it all started when I started working at my current company that I work at now. I just had my three year anniversary there, which was really exciting. Got a little balloon. We&#x27;re based in New York City and we&#x27;re called Teachers Pay Teachers or TPT for short. We&#x27;re an educational community and marketplace where teachers have stores on our site and create and sell resources that they create for other teachers. I was excited to start working at TPT as a software engineer. My mom&#x27;s a teacher. When I told her I was her I was interviewing there, she used it all the time. And I was going to work on a product to use my tech skills to make an impact on people&#x27;s lives, especially for teachers who work so hard.</p><p>This is a picture of team TPT. We&#x27;ve grown quite a bit since then. This is a very posed picture of me and a teammate on the team I worked on. But I really loved how collaborative it was. And I started out as a product engineer on the search and discovery team. And so, on TPT I think now we have over 4 million resources on our site. So, part of the objective of our team was to figure out how do we deliver the right resource at the right time to the right teacher? And I specifically was working mostly as a frontend engineer. And this is my second engineering job. So, I was really excited to dig into owning a bigger project.</p><p>This is what the site looked like when I joined in 2016, which was interesting. And I was really excited to work on a new project to bring it into modern day design. But we didn&#x27;t want to change too much about how it actually functioned. This was for a few reasons. We first wanted to take an approach of moving it to a completely different stack as well, that they had decided on, I think finalized, like, the week I got there. I thought was going to be working on a PHP monolith legacy site and it ended up we were going to rebuild something where I would be working on Node app that called out to an Elixir graph API which was really exciting and working with React.</p><p>So, my first project was working on the frontend of that with my teammates to rebuild this. And in addition to learning about our new tech stack, it involved figuring out what are all the different pieces of this page? And not only the visual pieces you see, but how does filtering work? What tracking do we have on the page and how do we want to rebuild all\u00a0of that? I felt really good about where we were after working super collaboratively with team. This is what it looks like now\u00a0that we launched it. But before we were launching, there was a problem. I thought we were all features ready to go.</p><p>It turns out that even though the legacy codebase was a little difficult for developers to work in, it was very fast, and it turns out the new search page we had built was much slower and that was a launch blocker. So, you can imagine I was a little nervous about this. I didn&#x27;t really know what to do, but knew we had to work collaboratively. So, one thing I really love about the structure of our engineering team is that we have product engineers. But then we also have platform engineers.</p><p>So, like I said, I was working with a search and discovery product team. Product engineers are working on a specific part of the site. But then we have platform engineers. And so, I worked with our web platform team to figure out how can we update our tech stack and look into this problem so that we would be unblocked for launch?</p><p>And it turns out that this was so impactful to me that I actually ended up switching to that team because I really enjoyed those problems. And I&#x27;m now the tech lead and manager for that team. Which is very exciting. And so, we answer a lot of questions generally about frontend things at TPT. But today I&#x27;m going to be talking about some ambiguous questions that can be hard to answer that we get, specifically about performance. So, imagine you have an anxious engineer, like me, back when I was trying to help my team launch the page. And they come to you and they say, we&#x27;re really trying to launch a new feature, but it&#x27;s too slow. What should we do? I definitely want to help out this anxious engineer. Let&#x27;s see what we can do.</p><p>Or you might have a frustrated user. Maybe this is somebody who wrote into our customer experience team saying something to the effect of, the home page seems slower than usual. Is something wrong? If you have been on the other side of trying to answer these questions, you can be like, that&#x27;s not enough information. I have no idea. But we also want to help them out as well. You can also imagine that once you tell people you&#x27;re working on something like web performance, things that might come up in the kitchen or in various meetings might be\u00a0\u2019so, you&#x27;re working on web performance\u201d. Like, is the site fast yet? Which is also a really hard question to answer. But I didn&#x27;t realize until I was the person being asked these questions.</p><p>Also, as I started to work on web performance with my team, we had to think about, hey, we&#x27;re doing all this work. What are we actually trying to gain and where are we trying to go? So, I want to get some answers for all of our various users. And I really love mysteries. And before I was a software engineer, I did a lot of scientific research. So, I love these like ambiguous hard to solve problems. And my favorite way of getting closer to solving a really hard question is to ask some follow up questions.</p><p>So, for this talk, I want us to put our detective hats on and to ask five follow up questions that can get you closer to an answer about how we can learn more about the performance of our current site and what it means for whatever you&#x27;re working on. And also, how this has to do a lot with communication and really being aligned with different stakeholders in whatever you&#x27;re building.</p><p>So, we&#x27;ll go through first why do we care? What does fast even mean? I have been using that term a lot. How do we measure performance? How fast is fast enough? And then, if we&#x27;re feeling good, how do we make sure it stays fast? So, let&#x27;s dive in. Let&#x27;s hopefully by the time we finish these questions, we can have some answers for our anxious engineer and our frustrated user. The first one is, why do we even care if the site is fast?</p><p>And I&#x27;ll first mention that maybe we don&#x27;t. And that&#x27;s a valid answer. But I think even taking time to think about that is a step in the right direction. At TPT we don&#x27;t have a specific performance team. Like, my team has that in addition to a bunch of other things to work on. It can be really hard to figure out when to prioritize performance and with smaller teams it&#x27;s harder. And there can be use cases where you have to make tradeoffs. There can be use cases where you&#x27;re experimenting with something. You kind of see what it looks like, you&#x27;re going to throw out the code or something, and you don&#x27;t to want worry about performance. But at least you made an explicit decision. Or maybe you&#x27;re prototyping something. And, again, it doesn&#x27;t really make sense for your specific use case. Though, I will say I would caution against thinking that any experimentation, you shouldn&#x27;t thinking performance in the beginning. Because it&#x27;s much easier to think about it and have a baseline for thinking about performance when you&#x27;re getting started rather than going back at the end. I always warn people about this, but in almost all cases, you are concerned about performance.</p><p>And so, what&#x27;s been really helpful for us is to think about how does performance affect our users? Like I said, TPT is a site for educators. And everyone is really on board with our mission, which is why I love working there - empowering educators to teach at their best. So, when we talk about performance, I like to get everyone bought in by figuring out, like, how can we align that really critically to our mission? So, if the website&#x27;s slower, you can imagine that will cause a lot of stress or frustration for teachers who already have a really stressful job. And I definitely don&#x27;t want to do that. And that&#x27;s definitely not supporting our mission.</p><p>Also, like I mentioned, my team&#x27;s mission was to find the teachers the right resource at the right time. And if we are making a fast website that&#x27;s literally saving teachers time. And so, this is a really powerful way to get people bought into why we should even think about web performance. So, I would encourage you to think about how you might do that for whatever products you&#x27;re working on, or whatever tech you&#x27;re working on as well.</p><p>Okay. So, we figured out that we care about performance. But what does fast even mean? This was really hard to explain to people who kind of wanted a yes or no answer when they asked me about site performance, or, like, give me a number in like seconds. And I was like, eh, it&#x27;s not possible. But I can get you some various answers. But I think first it&#x27;s important to align on what we actually want to measure together. And, again, I don&#x27;t think this should just be the job of engineers or people who are engineers working on performance. I think this is really collaborative. It can be with other people in marketing or also in product. Various designers. I worked with a lot of people on aligning on what these metrics are like. And this involved identifying key metrics that for our organization made sense. We decided it was important for us to look at metrics that are like industry standards as well as a speed index so we could understand the average time\u00a0things were displaying on our page.</p><p>Time to first byte. We wanted to get measurements on also responses from the API calls that were being called on the page so that we could have an understanding of what was contributing to our timings across various pages. Also, identifying what those key pages are. The search page is one page. But depending on what your search query is, what your filtering is, it can be an infinite amount of pages. How do you test that and what metrics are important for you? This was an ongoing conversation. What was really helpful was the communication aspect of this.</p><p>So, there&#x27;s lots of documentation to link and sometimes that was enough to send to engineers. But sometimes it&#x27;s more impactful to show a designer or product person the Filmstrips of your device loading, and what that will mean with devices and Internet speeds. Aligning your metrics to what people would care about was very critical. As well as since we talked about why you got everyone bought in on performance, let&#x27;s go ahead and connect those metrics to that. So, for example, for the search page, we know we really want teachers to be able to interact with the pages. It&#x27;s probably important that we keep track of a metric like time to interactive. This was a good example to get us all aligned so what fast means. Even though I couldn&#x27;t give a one word answer, this was a great way to get all on the same page.</p><p>Okay. We have our foundation. So, like, really, how fast is the site? Let&#x27;s get some more concrete answers. And the way we&#x27;ve gone about this is by conducting performance audits. I&#x27;ll juice the example of the search page port again. We have done a few of those. Moving over to the new stack, which is exciting. And performance audits is a way to get aligned and work on it collaboratively. And we have used various toolings that we decided to use at TPT to get an overview picture of what we want to measure. We have used tools like Lighthouse and Speed Curve that bring in data from web page tests. And Lighthouse also, but also make great graphs that we can show to people outside of engineering that are clear. We&#x27;ve also used a tool called Catchpoint, we can run synthetic monitoring tests across various nodes throughout the world. And all of these have given us a better picture of what the current page or feature that we&#x27;re trying to work on is like right now.</p><p>This also helps us figure out as we make our changes, can we test that and compare them? And then that can give us a better understanding of where we&#x27;re trying to go. And what I really learned from doing this exercise, speaking of testing on multiple browsers, this was really important for performance. And also, for us to take into account like what type of browsers teachers might use who use our website. Are they on their school Wi Fi? What types of devices are they use something they&#x27;re probably not using the same types of devices that have the same power that we do. It&#x27;s important to test in different ways.</p><p>We used a lot of synthetic testing for this as well. And also, it helped us make decisions. For example, doing a home page port, we decided to launch and work incrementally. So, we first launched a logged out homepage that we felt good about on desktop but knew we still needed to do work on performance for mobile. And doing a performance audit really helped us think about those tradeoffs.</p><p>And I mentioned Catchpoint. That&#x27;s a cool tool for us for availability and performance monitoring. Because we&#x27;re able to see and run synthetic tests from different nodes across the world. At TPT 70% of teachers have downloaded or resourced from us in the US. But we have users who use us outside of the US. And it&#x27;s important for us to understand what their performance experience is like as well. So, this was something we wanted to do as well in our performance audits. And that helped us get a good sense of how fast is the site. So, you&#x27;ve done this work. You&#x27;ve collected some metrics.</p><p>And from those metrics, then you&#x27;ve taken the steps to figure out what you might want to try. Maybe you realize, okay, \u00a0we&#x27;re loading two large. Let&#x27;s work on that. Or we want to load less fonts on mobile. Let&#x27;s try that and see how that affects metrics. Or somebody else go and figure out what we can lazy load in. So, while everyone&#x27;s working on that, I would suggest the first step is just aligning on how, like, what are you working towards? So, how fast is fast enough? You could kind of work on performance forever.</p><p>So, again, I&#x27;m really into collaboration. I think this is really important to work with product on to define success. My team can help inform that, but we don&#x27;t know specifically about each products&#x27; need and their roadmap. So, we like to work collaboratively with them to figure out what are you trying to optimize for and how can we help you get the right information to do that? And then also as we make changes, we want to get you unblocked as soon as possible so you can start meeting your goals. so, how can we do that?</p><p>Something I really encourage is A/B testing performance changes. Like this for several reasons. I just love testing. Maybe also from my science background. But it gives you a better sense of are the changes you&#x27;re making actually doing what you think they want to do? And this is also a great way to tie other user metrics you might care about performance changes. And having this historical data makes it way easier to advocate for making performance changes in the future.</p><p>So, you can say, hey, remember that test we ran where we really improved the speed index and also changed maybe the click through rate? Then you can say, let&#x27;s take time to do that again. If that&#x27;s gonna help your users and help impact the metrics that you care about.</p><p>Also, you can set some benchmarks. So, this can be against comparable pages. So, for example, for that search page we were saying, ah, the old site&#x27;s pretty good. We felt good about the speed. Let&#x27;s say we&#x27;re aiming for that. Or you can look at a competitor and say, okay. Maybe we want to be as fast as this other eCommerce site. Let&#x27;s look at some metrics there that&#x27;s comparable. Or maybe it&#x27;s dependent on your tech stack. Maybe you have different expectations for mobile and desktop. So, setting these benchmarks ahead of time will make it feel like you&#x27;re actually working towards a goal as you make all of these performance changes. Which is really important.</p><p>So, the last question. Maybe you&#x27;ve done this. You&#x27;ve made all of your changes. You&#x27;re feeling good. You feel like you have more information on performance. So, how do we make sure that it stays fast? I&#x27;ve seen that, you know, one code change can take all the hard work you&#x27;ve done and completely degrade the performance. So, how do we make sure that doesn&#x27;t happen?</p><p>And I would really encourage all of you to think of performance as a product requirement. That would have helped me a lot and saved a lot of stress if we had thought about that as critically as other product requirements of porting over the search page. And this is a lesson I definitely took to heart. And I think it&#x27;s just important. I like to think of performance as something that we can help other teams learn more about. So, my team likes to think about what tooling can we have in place to help others make informed decisions? So, it doesn&#x27;t have to just be tooling. We&#x27;ve taken time to take all of these performance audits. And something that we&#x27;ve done is making sure that we are very clear on what audience they&#x27;re for.</p><p>Usually it&#x27;s for quite a few different audiences. So, something that&#x27;s been really helpful is, we put all of the details at the bottom for what somebody might want to look at. And at the top, put a summary. Also, like I said, those definitions to all of the metrics is really helpful. But some other tooling we have in places. Our first step was saying, how can we let engineers know if their product made things, if they deploy or change made something slower? Maybe in their PR, maybe they get information about how their changes affect performance. We have done this by showing people how their change affects the size of the JavaScript that we&#x27;ll be sending. Or even better, how can we help people think locally as they start making changes about how what they&#x27;re doing will affect performance later on.</p><p>And all of this tooling we want to put in place just to make it as easy as possible to not degrade. And like I said, I think this is all about making balanced tradeoffs. There&#x27;s so many things we want to do to work on performance at my company. And we don&#x27;t have as much time. And sometimes it can feel like when you add monitoring, that you just introduce a whole new set of problems that you didn&#x27;t know existed before. And you kind of wish you could go back to when you didn&#x27;t know about them. But like I said, I like mysteries. And I&#x27;ve found it\u2019s actually really great that we now know these things that are probably affecting users that we didn&#x27;t know about before. And now we can take action, even if it&#x27;s small action or small steps to making it better. And every time we do that, we are supporting our mission of helping educators.</p><p>And so, like I said, something that&#x27;s been helpful has been how can we automate this process as much as possible? Something my team does from Catchpoint. You&#x27;re able to send a report of the last week of data and also of the last four weeks of data. While some changes are abundantly clear that it&#x27;s gotten slower after one deploy, we&#x27;ve also Ann seen performance changes that get slowly worse over time. And\u00a0so, someone doesn&#x27;t notice until like two weeks of looking at four weeks of data and then we can dig into it. Having the reports automated and sent to us on email or Slack when we stop looking at our emails. Has been a great way for us to be more aware of keeping our site fast and also high quality. Okay. So, we&#x27;ve made it through all of the questions. We can take our detective hat off. And let&#x27;s see if we can help anxious engineer by going through some of these questions with them.</p><p>So, as a reminder, they&#x27;re trying to launch a new feature. But it&#x27;s too slow. What should they do? So, let&#x27;s think about why do we care about performance in this case? So, in this case, we want to deliver an equal or better user experience than teachers are already finding resources with success on our site. We don&#x27;t want switching to a new stack to affect that in any way negatively. Okay. So, we&#x27;re aligned on that. Now, let&#x27;s align on what does fast even mean? I mentioned before we had time to interactive, time to first byte and different responses and also measuring our different API response times. Cool. So, we&#x27;re also aligned on that. We then did a performance audits to figure out where the old page was really good. And where we were currently with our new product that we wanted to launch. And then we were able to look into what changes could we make? And that was a lot of brainstorming and figuring out using a lot of the speed tooling that I think we&#x27;ll hear about to figure out what changes we can make. But we also aligned on from the beginning where we were trying to go.</p><p>So, we knew we wanted it to, okay, we&#x27;ll feel good about launching when it&#x27;s just as fast as the old one. Or comparable. And we got it that place after a lot of work. Which is awesome. And then we were able to launch. Can then we did our fifth step of make sure we had monitoring of the performance of the page for later. So, that we could keep track of this and not have to do a full audit like this in the future of this specific use case.</p><p>So, going through all of that, while it wasn&#x27;t, again, just an easy answer, we helped anxious engineer feel okay. And feel really supported. Which is always really great. And one of my favorite parts of my job. All right. Let&#x27;s see if we can also help frustrated user. When they say the home page seems slower than usual. Is something wrong? So, we care about this because if our users are frustrated, that&#x27;s not helping us with what we want to do. Also, let&#x27;s think about, seems slower than usual? So, seems like it was okay before. Is there a timeline? Is this the only user complaining about this? Or other people? Can we reproduce? Does it seem slow? Do we have monitoring in place that shows anything around the different metrics that we think are important? What about the page seems slower? Images not loading in? Are you not seeing certain content? Or there&#x27;s no content not show up at all for a while. So, getting more information about that can help us dig into where we might want to make changes. And if it turns out that the home page is slower, let&#x27;s agree to figure out like how many changes we want to make, and we can allocate resources to that.</p><p>Because, like I said, if performance is a product requirement, it should be way easier to prioritize. Then let&#x27;s say something was wrong and you&#x27;re able to fix it. That&#x27;s really great for your user. And also, the monitoring you had in place, hopefully, helped you get an answer very quickly. And now, this user can go back to teaching. And getting all of the resources that they wanted. So, we also helped them.</p><p>So, we still have this large question of, is the site fast yet? And I&#x27;m sorry to say that I do not have a clear answer to this as you might have been able to tell from the rest of this talk. But I will say that I felt way better about being able to tackle different web performance challenges just by going through this and by thinking really incrementally. And also, by just starting from a place of understanding and collaboration and working together and not just thinking that this is just an engineering problem.</p><p>And so, I like to think about these five steps we went through because we do have some answers. We now know why we care about performance for whatever we&#x27;re working on. We have a shared understanding of what fast means. We have ideas of ways to measure performance. We have also a shared understanding of how fast is fast enough and where we&#x27;re trying to go. And we have some plans for how to stay fast. And so, I hope that if you&#x27;ve ever felt intimidated by a big question like this or not known where to start with web performance or felt like you didn&#x27;t have the time, this will give you some inspiration to getting a little closer into digging into that.</p><p>Thank you so much.</p>",

		"transcript": "<p>You have to endure this for the next 30 minutes. Be prepared. Hi, I&#x27;m Surma. I want to talk about polyglot WebAssembly. That&#x27;s a word that I made up. Polyglot basically meaning the ability to read, write or speak a variety or several languages. And WebAssembly is a pretty good representative of that skill, really.</p><p>And since you are all here, you are all most likely polyglot. Because, you know, web development alone involves three languages, HTML, JavaScript and CSS. Welcome, you&#x27;re polyglot. If you&#x27;re interested in WebAssembly, you might know one of the WebAssembly languages. That&#x27;s nice. But talking about WebAssembly, I tend to mention three tools or three languages that cover very different use cases on the spectrum of WebAssembly. And those are Emscripten, Rust and AssemblyScript. It&#x27;s a replacement for the compiler. If you use GCC or clang, you will use MCC to compile your C code to WebAssembly.</p><p>And Rust, the language Mozilla has been developing and growing a vibrant ecosystem and community around it. Rust has native support for WebAssembly built into the main compiler which is great and works well.</p><p>And AssemblyScript is something I&#x27;m excited about. Which is a language that uses the exact same syntax as TypeScript. Not that you can take TypeScript and compile to WebAssembly, but you can use the skills with TypeScript and use AssemblyScript. And you can play with WebAssembly without having to learn a new language if you&#x27;re a web developer.</p><p>Just to talk a little bit about the spectrum I was mentioning of WebAssembly, one thing I look at is the just works dimension. And Emscripten is the prime example. They aim to be a drop in replacement for your old C compiler. The problem you have been in C++ or written before WebAssembly was a thing, Emscripten aims to make that compile and make that run on the web. They do magic and heavy lifting to make it run on the web. Rust is good here as well. They don&#x27;t do all that magic straight out of the box. It is a little bit more likely that code that hasn&#x27;t been written specifically for the web will not just compile out of the box, and you will need to tweak a little bit. But most of the things can be made to work with WebAssembly and on the web with just a couple of support libraries.</p><p>AssemblyScript is very different. AssemblyScript is a low level language. It&#x27;s a very thin layer on top of Assembly, almost, for WebAssembly. And so, you have to do a lot of things yourself. And that shouldn&#x27;t necessarily scare you to take a look at it. Because it also gives you a lot of control and a lot of understanding of what WebAssembly can and cannot do. Don&#x27;t let this deter you from looking at AssemblyScript. It&#x27;s very enjoyable and I would recommend it.</p><p>Another I want to talk about is the output size because that&#x27;s something as we all know that matters on the web. How much bytes does the user have to download to start what you wrote? And AssemblyScript is good, you are in full control. You write really, really small modules. On the order of a couple hundred bytes. Rust I put a little bit higher. And they will agree with. That&#x27;s because by default Rust modules will be quite big. But Rust has the ability to generate just small modules. But that will require you to go and add meticulously crafted code to get to the small file size. You can do it, but it&#x27;s not automatically that small. And Emscripten is the biggest. It does all this magic, lots of heavy lifting under the hood. If you use a file system, it will get the file system and that needs code. And I will talk about that later on.</p><p>And the last thing in terms of the spectrum is the ecosystem around it. AssemblyScript being its own language, fairly small team and new, there&#x27;s not much there. But they do a lot with what they have. Please take a look. I find it enjoyable. Rust has grown incredibly in the last year or two or three. And has a huge ecosystem. I&#x27;m impressed with how many things I can find in the Rust ecosystem thrown at the web. And, of course, no one can compete with the ecosystem that&#x27;s been around for decades. It&#x27;s huge and most of these things you can use with Emscripten. And there&#x27;s more languages that\u00a0coming to WebAssembly. That&#x27;s what this is about, the polyglot WebAssembly.</p><p>Honorable mentions. One of them is Go that has experimental support. You can write Go programs, compile them to WebAssembly and run them. They are very big currently. Mostly due to the fact that Go is both garbage collected and makes use of co routines which WebAssembly doesn&#x27;t have native support for just yet. They have to bundle all that runtime code for themselves. Meaning it is quite big. But in the future, that will probably go down once these features come to WebAssembly. And the exact same applies to Blazor, which is a project that brings the .NET to WebAssembly. C#, they are the same problems, they have co routines and currently they are quite big. But definitely worth looking at and playing around with if you come from a C# background, for example.</p><p>And the last one is LLVM. It&#x27;s a compiler back and project that Clang came from. And it&#x27;s been around for quite a while. But since version 8, they have their WebAssembly support in stable. If you use Clang, you can compile C code to WebAssembly just with Clang. And switched to the new LLVM under the hood. If you use Clang yourself manually, you will not have a standard library. Which can be both cool and very intimidating. If you want to know about this, I wrote an article that you can find here. You have no Malloc, no sine function, you have to write it yourself. But it can be an interesting experience. Probably not ready for production.</p><p>And the number of languages that support WebAssembly will only grow. For example, what if some idiot went on to npm and wrote a new compiler for a language called, I can&#x27;t say it on stage. But it&#x27;s brain clock. If you don&#x27;t know it, it looks like this. And that&#x27;s what you want for the enterprise engineers to write their code in. It&#x27;s very enjoyable. Basically, it&#x27;s a bare bones touring machine. More of an educational device than something you would ever write production code in. But I did it anyway.</p><p>This is real. This is a compiler that you can use. You write your code in brain\u00a0 clock! Is and once you write the code, you can do the JOSM code. That&#x27;s my compiler. I&#x27;m now a compiler engineer.</p><p>And I want to talk about it, after reading how WebAssembly is under the hood, I want to see WebAssembly in education. When I was in university, I wanted to write assembler and write an operating system. And then learn about the process on the laptops, they&#x27;re bonkers. There&#x27;s no way to actually understand how they work and know every instruction that they have.</p><p>So, what I am saying, is don&#x27;t be afraid to go to WebAssembly.org and just click that spec button. Because the spec is actually kind of well written. And the virtual machine is very well designed. Actually, I was able to understand just by casually reading through the spec. And just to be clear. I&#x27;m not saying that every web developer needs to do this. You don&#x27;t need to do this if you want to make effective use of WebAssembly or be a good web developer. This is just if you&#x27;re curious. If you&#x27;re interested.</p><p>The spec can look daunting because it repeats itself four times over, once for validation, execution, the binary and text format. But if you want to get started with super low level Assembly, and I wrote a blog post. If you&#x27;re curious as a secondary introduction how to write text format which look like this. And I would almost call that readable. Okay. Enough of that. Go back to polyglottism and languages. And all that stuff.</p><p>I want to talk about Squoosh. It&#x27;s an app we wrote last year. It&#x27;s an image come possessor PWA. A web app that works offline, has all the good PWA bits and makes heavy use of WebAssembly. This is what it looks like. The point is it can drop the image and select a PNG and a JPEG codex, and we expose them, and you can apply around and see how the changes affect the visual of your image. And we also supply a couple of different scaling algorithms.</p><p>And all these things run in the browser. 100%. There is no server side. It&#x27;s all WebAssembly. And all these WebAssembly modules have been implemented with different languages. So, all these codex for images you often find on GitHub or wherever, are written in C. Because C is somewhat easy to embed in many other runtimes. So, all the codex are C or C++. We actually found a really nice image resizing library in the Rust ecosystem. That part is from Rust. And we have a piece of AssemblyScript that rotates images.</p><p>If you&#x27;re wondering why we have a piece of AssemblyScript just to rotate an image, that will absolutely blow the scope of this talk. There&#x27;s another article I wrote where we found out that JavaScript can be fairly unpredictable whether it comes to performance. But really the point here is that we have multiple languages working together in the browser. Which I think is kind of cool. So, WebAssembly itself only understands numbers. Like you have a couple of different types much numbers like 32 bit integers, 64 bit integers, floats. But things like strings, objects, dictionaries, arrays, WebAssembly doesn&#x27;t know about them.</p><p>What most compilers do is generate a .wasm file you with the WebAssembly machine code and a wrapper in JavaScript. It&#x27;s called the JavaScript glue code which turns this low level interface of the WebAssembly module into something that can accept strings and arrays and makes it a bit nicer to work with. One of the first things we notice when working with WebAssembly is the pieces of glue code can become quite big. And I say big because I personally have a super low threshold for file size. Many people will ship 500 kilo bytes or a megabyte to production and won&#x27;t flinch. For me, 30 kilobytes. It&#x27;s fair for what it&#x27;s doing, it does a lot of heavy lifting under the hood.</p><p>As an example, Emscripten&#x27;s role is to be a drop replacement for whatever C compiler you have in the project. The standard library of C is designed as an abstraction over whatever operating system you&#x27;re on and so, a high level function like F put S, which writes a string to a file, has at some point under the hood mapped to something called a syscall, at least on Linux systems. And syscalls are a weird function of abstract functions from the kernel of the system. And most calls will at some level map to the syscalls. What Emscripten is doing is emulating the entire kernel interface in JavaScript and mapping it to sensible web APIs if so required. So, for example, if you open a file, it will start emulating a file system for you so that your C code can be working just fine.</p><p>If you use OpenGL in your C code, it will pull in WebGL and start piping those two things together. And, of course, there&#x27;s a lot of code to do that. There&#x27;s corner cases and whatnot and, yeah, so, the file size will grow over time. And on further inspection, realized that between multiple modules the glue code is almost the same barring a couple of constants, a couple of individual functions. So, and that makes sense because the way you turn a JavaScript C\u00a0 JavaScript string into a C string will most likely stay the same. I&#x27;m working with the Emscripten team hoping that we can somehow make this more reusable, re sharable. Currently the user of Squoosh has to download the same code twice or three times. I&#x27;m hoping to do better in the future. But in the long term future, there&#x27;s an upcoming standard from the WA SM working group that I want to talk about for a little bit. It&#x27;s called WASI, the WebAssembly System Interface.</p><p>You can think of WASI kind of as a standardized kernel, almost, for WebAssembly. It&#x27;s super early. So, don&#x27;t bet your money on this just yet. It&#x27;s being worked on. It&#x27;s just a couple of READMEs really. It&#x27;s exciting. And interview questions to focus on it. It&#x27;s focusing on WASI Core, you can access like crypto\u00a0devices. For now, it&#x27;s Core. Which is mostly motivated by the use case of running WebAssembly outside the browser on a desktop machine. Because what happens currently happen is that WebAssembly was kind of conceived with the use case of running on the web. But since then, there&#x27;s more use case of running it embedded in your Android or iOS app or even stand alone on your desktop. It&#x27;s becoming like a universal binary format which I think is really exciting.</p><p>But, of course, in that scenario you need access to files and to network sockets. And that is really what a WASI is providing. So, since Emscripten is already emulating the entire kernel, I think WASI could be a really interesting use case. You&#x27;re asking yourself, did I add WASI support to my compiler, of course, I did. And you instantiate a WebAssembly module on the web in a node, do this. You will use instantiate and pass in the WebAssembly module as the operator. And the interesting thing is WebAssembly is 100% isolated. It has a chunk of memory and it can to arithmetic on the memory, that&#x27;s it. It doesn&#x27;t have access to anything, not a single web API. You can only pass in any external functions through that imports object in the second parameter. And so, by default, the modules that my compiler generates expect two functions. The in function and the out function. Brain\u00a0clock! Needs to communicate with the external walls.</p><p>Now, in WASI land, things like a bit different. You&#x27;re basically putting all of these individual functions into the namespace that WASI has, WASI Core or WASI crypto. I&#x27;m only allowing the module to read and write from file descriptors. That&#x27;s interesting because it cannot open any files. It still doesn&#x27;t get access to the file system. It can only read and write to file decrypters. And only has access to standard in and out. In terms of security, this is a nice model because you have to explicitly give each individual app to use certain APIs on your host system.</p><p>And now, of course, if you use my compiler and use the WASI flag, you get out a new WebAssembly file. And wasmer and wasmtime are implementing WASI to experiment with. And it prints hello world. I thought that was kind of cool. I was proud when that happens. But, again, super earlier. It&#x27;s mostly READMEs. But there are some experimental runtimes which are quite fun to play with.</p><p>Now to another part is that the tools that WebAssembly has are also polyglot because they don&#x27;t even care what language you use. They just care that they can look at the WebAssembly and work on that. So, a couple of times I want to point out is wasm strip. Looks at the module and strips out everything that&#x27;s unnecessary. Debug functions. It helps make the modules smaller. Wasm validate, checks that it&#x27;s semantically correct. As a compiler engineer, that&#x27;s helpful. And wasm opt which I want to talk about. Mostly it just aims to make your WebAssembly module fast and small.</p><p>One thing that you should always do pretty much when you run or deploy a WebAssembly module is run wasm opt because it will never make a WebAssembly module worse. But it will always make it a tiny bit better. And sometimes it&#x27;s a lifesaver. For example, in the case of my wasi/wasm module, it made it smaller. It&#x27;s not their fair it, it&#x27;s a non on opt hissing compiler. I didn&#x27;t want to make it messy by making smart optimizations. But also, I knew that wasm opt existed and that would take care of most of the obvious optimizations for me after the fact. And I think that is actually quite nice.</p><p>But there is a fun story here from Squoosh, actually. I wanted to ship HQX. Which is an image scaling algorithm specifically tailored to pixel art. And I found it in implementation in rust. And so, I ported it to WASM. It worked great, upscaling results. It looked good. But in Chrome, the CPU got locked in at like 200% for like 2 minutes after I loaded the module. Which was weird because everything was working. And so, it turns out that the WebAssembly that the Rust compiler was generating was like a nasty edge case for the optimizing compiler in v8 for WebAssembly. And so, I look at it a little bit. The file starts fairly normal and the blocks start, and they just keep going. And it&#x27;s A lot of blocks. Like 3700 blocks. That&#x27;s a really long blockchain. So, lift off the streaming compiler actually just looked at the generated code and ran. And that&#x27;s why it worked straight up. But the optimizing was working in the background and trying for two minutes to optimize this mess. This is not good on a mobile device. Just turn in your CPU at 200%. That&#x27;s not a good idea.</p><p>So, yeah. What we did instead, we figured out that wasm opt can help. It didn&#x27;t know it was Rust. It looked at it. It took 20 minutes to go through the entire module. But that&#x27;s build time. Build time is much more expensive than your client&#x27;s mobile battery time. Less expensive. After 20 minutes, we had a module that was 100K smaller. But also, the blockchain was only 700 or 800 blocks long. We didn&#x27;t see the CPU blocking on Chrome anymore. It was cool. Rust didn&#x27;t have optimal code, it was fine. And wasm opt fixed it without knowing it was rust. And that&#x27;s cool, I thought.</p><p>But now to one of my most exciting tools is Asyncify. Was announced back in the context of Emscripten. Most missed it as an Emscripten tool. It&#x27;s part of wasm opt and therefore also language agnostic. So, what does it do?</p><p>So, as I said, Emscripten will emulate a file system for you. An example where I encountered there. You can use file operations in your C code and picture store that file system in memory or it can put it into local storage. And I had a use case where I wanted to store the file system not in local storage, but in index DB. And index DB, as some of you might know, is a promise based API. And so, that means that at some point a call like fputs would have to work with IDB which was a promise and needed to be awaited. Now, WebAssembly is inherently synchronous and doesn&#x27;t understand promise. I didn&#x27;t want it to return until it was written or persisted to the database. So, I was in trouble here, really.</p><p>Because, you know, there&#x27;s no wait. And that&#x27;s exactly what Asyncify solves for you. You can pause WebAssembly and do asynchronous work and pause stuff. And tell WebAssembly, go back, resume, execute. You can make somethings that asynchronous look synchronous to WebAssembly. So, Emscripten itself has a really nice abstraction where you can just write some inline JavaScript and make a wakeup callback and call whenever you&#x27;re ready for WebAssembly to resume. But it is language agnostic. So, did I add it to my compiler. This is a very simple brain talk where we read from the inputs and print it back out. And do it over and over. It&#x27;s a read write loop. Now, the thing is with input, if there&#x27;s nothing available to read from the input, we would have to wait and wait is inherently asynchronous. So, how do we do that on the web? We can now do this because Asyncify.</p><p>This is pseudo code, but you can say wait, pause everything, and wait for a key press to happen. Once I have a key press, I will resume WebAssembly and return whatever key I have. When I look at that, really what I&#x27;ve built here is an utterly unimpressive typewriter. But the potential behind it is kind of come because if you think about often C APIs are often synchronous. If you want to talk to a USB device in C, those are synchronous. But then on the web, it&#x27;s asynchronous. There was no way to plug the two APIs together. But now you can. That will open up doors for WebAssembly to marry to web APIs and make things work on the web that didn&#x27;t work on the web before.</p><p>Let&#x27;s get back to Squoosh for a little bit at the end. As I said, we use a bunch of different modules from different languages. Each language may or may not add some glue code. In addition to the app JavaScript code that we have that orchestrates everything. Really what our app does when you compress an image is this. You have an image data, an array buffer of pixel values. And then rotate it with AssemblyScript, resize with some Rust. And then at the end, run it through a compressor and enter through a JPEG or PNG. Looking at this, we don&#x27;t really have performance problems per se. It&#x27;s all off main thread. And image compression takes a bit of time. It&#x27;s not going to be super snappy fast. But we can all agree that this looks a little bit unnecessary. Wouldn&#x27;t it be cooler if we could do this instead?</p><p>And this is now something being worked on in the WebAssembly working group under the name of interface types. This is even earlier than the rest of the stuff I talked about. But the point of this proposal is to bring higher level types to WebAssembly. So, as I mentioned before, WebAssembly only does numbers, but with this proposal, there&#x27;s now a way to add support for things like strings or lists or dictionaries or objects. But not necessarily in the way you might be thinking.</p><p>Because WebAssembly will remain to only understand numbers. So, a WebAssembly module looks kind of like this. It&#x27;s a module, it has a couple of exports. These exports are most often just functions. And these functions can only work with numbers. These different types of numbers that WebAssembly has. Now, with if your language uses lists or strings or dictionaries, under the hood they have a mechanism to map those to like memory addresses and lengths and offsets. Like to numbers. But that&#x27;s not really like a good user interface to use.</p><p>So, what they have been thinking up is that a module can now bundle a second definition of itself that uses these higher level types. So, now we have a function that takes a string and a function that takes an entire JSON object and then the module will bundle small tiny functions that know how to translate these higher level types to whatever language you were using under the hood and turn those into calls on the low level language.</p><p>So, this way we now have an interface of the module with high level types that we can use as developers and be comfortable with that. And the translation code block will be working with the language in the memory. This is cool for us as developers. But it also means that now multiple modules can use these higher level types to communicate. Because a C string will be different from a Go string and a C# string. But now they have an abstract concept of a string and can use it to invoke each other&#x27;s functions. Which I think is going to be interesting.</p><p>Of course, there is more future stuff, SIMD is working on. Threads are in Chrome, and soon in Firefox, I hope. There&#x27;s Tail calls as a proposal. That means that we are entering the world where some browsers have support for features and others not yet. And for that reason, I wrote a small library called WASM feature detect that does what it says and tell you if a browser has a support for a certain feature or doesn&#x27;t. If you&#x27;re excited about this, or tickles your interest, try it out. Hit me up on Twitter. I would love to hear what your ideas are. And with that, thank you for your attention.</p>",

		"transcript": "<p>Hi. I&#x27;m Kadir\u00a0Topal. I started my career as a web developer in the late &#x27;90s. And for the last couple years, I have been the product manager for MDN. Yes, we have done this MDN web development needs assessment. So, this project that I&#x27;m about to talk to you about started late in 2017. That was shortly after CSS Grid was fixed. And CSS Grid was actually a massive success. In the Mozilla developers relations team, we asked ourselves, how can we have more of these wins? How can we support that so that we do this again and again?</p><p>And CSS Grid was a success. And it addressed user needs. It shipped in all the browsers at roughly the same time and it came with tooling. In the case of Firefox, it was the Grid Inspector. And that was seriously awesome. But that said, CSS Grid was years in the making. And layout had been an issue at least since the late &#x27;90s when we abused tables to implement our UI designs.</p><p>So, looking at this, we had a few questions. Why did it take until 2012 to address this problem and 2017 to ship it to developers? How was this coordinated so it would roughly at the same time in all of the major browsers? What were the road blocks for that and what were the critical elements to keep it moving? We took a step back to look at it from Mozilla&#x27;s perspective, mostly.</p><p>After interviewing numerous people involved in the process, we identified three distinct phases. You have the research phase, the standardization implementation and the adoption phase. And now as you can probably tell, this is a very simplified process. It smooths over many things. And it looks like a pipeline when it&#x27;s actually like a loop or a loop of loops that loop on themselves. I mean, you get the idea. But this was good enough for us to get started.</p><p>And most of us had a pretty good idea about the adoption side because that&#x27;s where MDN is. And that&#x27;s where MDN shines. And we had some idea about the standardization implementation aspect of this. But we wanted to know about the research phase. How do we learn about developer pain points? What they need and what we should prioritize for the platform. We interviewed more than ten people involved in the process at different stages of it, and it became clear that there was no formal research really. At Mozilla we have an amazing user research team when it comes to Firefox. But for developer research, that wasn&#x27;t as much the case. It wasn&#x27;t as established.</p><p>And this is important because at a place like Mozilla, we had limited resources. So, we can&#x27;t go after everything. And there are serious opportunity costs that we pay when we decide to do something. Because it usually means we can&#x27;t do something else. And that&#x27;s along the whole process. So, it&#x27;s standardization and implementation, but it&#x27;s the same thing when it comes to adoption.</p><p>So, this is what we heard from people that we interviewed. About how things are prioritized. And one thing really stood out. Because almost every single person said the same thing here. We need to hear from developers. And it makes so much sense. Because none of us can be successful without that part. It&#x27;s hard to prioritize the right things without knowing what developer pain points are. It&#x27;s hard to find the right solution, it&#x27;s hard to get people to adopt something if it doesn&#x27;t solve their problem really or if it doesn&#x27;t solve the problem in the right way. For all of those reasons, we proposed the developer needs assessment. So, what is that exactly?</p><p>It&#x27;s a prioritized list of designer and developer needs. It&#x27;s a single and simple tool for harsh prioritization that&#x27;s representing diverse populations and a huge feature space. It&#x27;s published on MDN. It&#x27;s not owned by a single vendor, though. We initially proposed this under the umbrella of the MDN board, we have representation from the W3C and industry stakeholders. Because we think as a community, we need to have at least a common understanding of the facts when it comes to needs. Even if we draw different conclusions from them.</p><p>And again finally, it&#x27;s reproduced annually. And this is important. As an industry, we need to know whether we are addressing developer pain points. And to understand whether we are prioritizing correctly. We need to track needs and pain points over time so we can see the impact of those efforts, essentially. And if you this well, we think the MDN developer needs assessment, or the MDN Web DNA for short, it can be a voice of designers and developers working on web. And asking about web developer and designer needs and frustrations is not trivial. Because the problem space is so vast. And the audience is so diverse.</p><p>So, let me tell you a little bit about the process we went through for that. We didn&#x27;t just slap a survey on the website. And I apologize up front because I&#x27;m not a researcher. We worked with the very talented Alison McKee from pinpoint research to do the research design and to conduct this. So, I&#x27;ll try to do my best to channel her here. In January of this year, we started the process by fielding a survey so the product advisory board members where we asked for data that they would use for decision making.</p><p>And then we had almost 20 in depth interviews with web developers and designers before putting together the initial version of the survey. And that is because we wanted the survey to be rooted in the voice of developers and designers. And we wanted to do that from the get-go. Had we run the survey without the interviews, the questions would have been based on the perception of browser vendors mostly. And by conducting the interviews, we made sure to derive the interview questions from the stories of designers about what is important to them in their work on the web. But also, what the frustrations are for them.</p><p>And to go from the interview findings to the survey, we followed pinpoints analysis process. Going from observations at the very bottom, what we saw and heard, essentially, to insights, what they mean, to critical themes on the highest level to look at why it matters.</p><p>And we are continuing that process to incorporate the survey findings that we learned from these pilot interviews. And in practice, that means we transcribed 16 hours of interviews. We then coded them. And we then bucket them to derive insights from the items in our survey. And that is a very hands on process.</p><p>Okay. So, wait. This is the coding. And this is bucket thing. So, this is a very hands on process where you actually print things out. So, based on these themes, we constructed the survey question around the frustration of web developers and designers. And we continued to work with our product advisory board on the overall survey with pilot interviews where we watched people take the survey at every iteration to make sure that the survey questions were as unambiguous as possible. And with the help from 30 stakeholders from various MDN advisory board members, telemetry\u00a0we put together the survey. It was fielded on MDN and through the channels of the board members, W3C, Google, Microsoft, Samsung and Bocoup. And it wasn&#x27;t just in English like this one.</p><p>We localized the survey in eight languages. It&#x27;s Arabic, simplified Chinese, English, French, Brazilian Portuguese and Spanish. It was important to get the input not just from people who speak and understand English. I&#x27;m happy to announce that after fielding this survey for more than four weeks, more than 76,000 people took us up on it, and more than 28,000 took the time to complete the survey from 173 countries, actually.</p><p>And just for the complete responses alone, that&#x27;s more than 10,000 hours of time that developers contributed to help us understand what their pain points and needs are. So, we really want to make sure we make use of that. We good use of that. And we believe that this makes the MDN web developer needs assessment the biggest web developer and designer focused survey ever conducted. And with that scale come benefits. We can segment the data by experience level, by developer role, country, satisfaction. And we still have very high confidence in the results we get from that because the segments are big enough. So, there are definitely benefits to getting this many responses.</p><p>So, after talking about the survey in the abstract for so long, I thought I would share a few questions aside from the core of the survey about things that developers find the most frustrating. And these are in particular order. How would you rate your overall satisfaction with the web as a platform and set of tools to even I believe you to build what you need or want? What are the things that you would like to be able to do on the web, but lack web platform features to do? And what are the biggest pain points for you when it comes to JavaScript development? And we asked the same questions for HTML and CSS and WebAssembly.</p><p>And since it&#x27;s boring to just see the questions, let me share a little bit about the results. The first one is the list of top five items that caused the most frustration across countries, roles, experience and so on.</p><p>The first on the list is interoperability. Having to support specific browsers. Yes, we do have to follow up. We will do a follow up on this about what browsers and what causes the biggest frustrations there. That&#x27;s number one.</p><p>The second one is documentation. But specifically, documentation for frameworks and libraries and tools. Not web standards. This is ranked much lower.</p><p>The third one, again, interoperability issue. But this time the fact that developers have to avoid using a feature because it&#x27;s just not implemented in all the browsers that they need to support. And fourth is testing across browsers. And fifth is once again an interoperability issue. This one about making design look and feel the same across different browsers. And I don&#x27;t know about you, but I see a seam in this.</p><p>So, in our final report, we&#x27;ll go back to the 16 hours of interviews and add detail and color for these items. Especially when it comes to interoperability because people did tell us in those interviews very specifically what causes themselves issues there.</p><p>The second item I want to share is this. When a new web technology that&#x27;s relevant to your needs becomes available, what are the main barriers to adoption? And usually when this question is asked, regardless of platform, the documentation and sample code is the answer. That is what most developers care about. And it&#x27;s indeed listed here. But it&#x27;s listed in second place. The number one issue is\u00a0 the number one issue and barrier to adoption is actually broad interoperability across browsers.</p><p>And it&#x27;s not all bad, though. So, we asked the question, what is the biggest pain point you have with HTML? The number one answer is nothing. At least for one third of the people we asked. So, people working on that are doing something right.</p><p>And finally, how would you rate your overall satisfaction with the web as a platform and set of tools to enable you to build what you need or want? And this is a full 76% are either satisfied or very satisfied. And that&#x27;s something to be proud of really as people who work on the web to push the web forward here of all places. So, I hope you can keep that in mind when you hear complaints about web development experiences. But this is something to celebrate too.</p><p>And we shouldn&#x27;t stop there. So, what I just showed was just a preview. So, this and much more than this we will put into the full report that we intend to publish by the end of this month. And as I said, we want this to be an annual thing. We don&#x27;t want this to be just a one time effort. So, the next iteration will start in March 2020. We&#x27;ll then field the survey hopefully in May and publish the results in September 2020. Hopefully around\u00a0before View Source so we can talk about it again at the View Source next year.</p><p>At least that&#x27;s the timeline that we intend to go with. Hopefully it will work out. And this is also where we need your help and input. This is the first iteration of the survey, it&#x27;s far from perfect, but it is a start. Since you are the target audience for this, we want\u00a0 we need your input for this. We want the next iteration to be much better. And we need you to tell us what are your target audiences? How useful is this for you? What level of granularity would you actually need to make decisions based on this? And the goal is to hear the voice of developers and designers working on the web and to have a single and simple tool for harsh prioritization representing diverse audiences. And a huge feature space. And I&#x27;m extremely excited that we&#x27;ve made the first step in that direction.</p><p>So, many thanks to everyone who has contributed to that and I&#x27;m looking forward to many more of these.</p>",
