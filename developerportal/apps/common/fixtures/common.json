Code outside of a browser needs a way to talk to the system\\u200a\\u2014\\u200aa system interface. And the WebAssembly platform doesn\\u2019t have that yet.</p><p><b>What:</b> WebAssembly is an assembly language for a conceptual machine, not a physical one. This is why it can be run across a variety of different machine architectures.</p><p>Just as WebAssembly is an assembly language for a conceptual machine, WebAssembly needs a system interface for a conceptual operating system, not any single operating system. This way, it can be run across all different OSs.</p><p>This is what WASI is\\u200a\\u2014\\u200aa system interface for the WebAssembly platform.</p><p>We aim to create a system interface that will be a true companion to WebAssembly and last the test of time. This means upholding the key principles of WebAssembly\\u200a\\u2014\\u200aportability and security.</p><p><b>Who:</b> We are chartering a WebAssembly subgroup to focus on standardizing <a href=\\\"https://wasi.dev/\\\">WASI</a>. We\\u2019ve already gathered interested partners, and are looking for more to join.</p><p>Here are some of the reasons that we, our partners, and our supporters think this is important:</p><h4>Sean White, Chief R&amp;D Officer of Mozilla</h4><p>\\u201cWebAssembly is already transforming the way the web brings new kinds of compelling content to people and empowers developers and creators to do their best work on the web. Up to now that\\u2019s been through browsers, but with WASI we can deliver the benefits of WebAssembly and the web to more users, more places, on more devices, and as part of more experiences.\\u201d</p><h4>Tyler McMullen, CTO of\\u00a0Fastly</h4><p>\\u201cWe are taking WebAssembly beyond the browser, as a platform for fast, safe execution of code in our edge cloud. Despite the differences in environment between our edge and browsers, WASI means WebAssembly developers won\\u2019t have to port their code to each different platform.\\u201d</p><h4>Myles Borins, Node Technical Steering committee director</h4><p>\\u201cWebAssembly could solve one of the biggest problems in Node\\u200a\\u2014\\u200ahow to get close-to-native speeds and reuse code written in other languages like C and C++ like you can with native modules, while still remaining portable and secure. Standardizing this system interface is the first step towards making that happen.\\u201d</p><h4>Laurie Voss, co-founder of\\u00a0npm</h4><p>\\u201cnpm is tremendously excited by the potential WebAssembly holds to expand the capabilities of the npm ecosystem while hugely simplifying the process of getting native code to run in server-side JavaScript applications. We look forward to the results of this process.\\u201d</p><p>So that\\u2019s the big news! \\ud83c\\udf89</p><p>There are currently 3 implementations of WASI:</p><ul><li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/CraneStation/wasmtime\\\">wasmtime</a>, Mozilla\\u2019s WebAssembly runtime</li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.fastly.com/blog/announcing-lucet-fastly-native-webassembly-compiler-runtime\\\">Lucet</a>, Fastly\\u2019s WebAssembly runtime</li><li><a href=\\\"https://wasi.dev/polyfill/\\\">a browser polyfill</a></li></ul><p>You can see WASI in action in this video:</p>\", \"id\": \"3160eb6e-8dd2-48f0-9ca1-0e24cda0463c\"}, {\"type\": \"paragraph\", \"value\": \"<p>And if you want to learn more about our proposal for how this system interface should work, keep reading.</p><h3>What\\u2019s a system interface?</h3><p>Many people talk about languages like C giving you direct access to system resources. But that\\u2019s not <i>quite</i> true<i>.</i></p><p>These languages don\\u2019t have direct access to do things like open or create files on most systems. Why not?</p><p>Because these system resources\\u200a\\u2014\\u200asuch as files, memory, and network connections\\u2014 are too important for stability and security.</p><p>If one program unintentionally messes up the resources of another, then it could crash the program.

People figured this out pretty early on, and came up with a way to provide this control: protection ring security.</p><p>With protection ring security, the operating system basically puts a protective barrier around the system\\u2019s resources. This is the kernel. The kernel is the only thing that gets to do operations like creating a new file or opening a file or opening a network connection.</p><p>The user\\u2019s programs run outside of this kernel in something called user mode. If a program wants to do anything like open a file, it has to ask the kernel to open the file for it.</p>\", \"id\": \"fef96f8a-4d79-4dfb-adbf-8bc4417abba5\"}, {\"type\": \"paragraph\", \"value\": \"<p>This is where the concept of the system call comes in.

But if each operating system has its own system calls, wouldn\\u2019t you need a different version of the code for each operating system? Fortunately, you don\\u2019t.</p><p>How is this problem solved? Abstraction.</p><p>Most languages provide a standard library. While coding, the programmer doesn\\u2019t need to know what system they are targeting. They just use the interface.</p><p>Then, when compiling, your toolchain picks which implementation of the interface to use based on what system you\\u2019re targeting.

In the same way, WebAssembly needs a system interface for a conceptual operating system, not a real operating system.</p><p>But there are already runtimes that can run WebAssembly outside the browser, even without having this system interface in place. How do they do it? Let\\u2019s take a look.</p><h3>How is WebAssembly running outside the browser\\u00a0today?</h3><p>The first tool for producing WebAssembly was Emscripten. It emulates a particular OS system interface, POSIX, on the web. This means that the programmer can use functions from the C standard library (libc).</p><p>To do this, Emscripten created its own implementation of libc. This implementation was split in two\\u200a\\u2014\\u200apart was compiled into the WebAssembly module, and the other part was implemented in JS glue code. This JS glue would then call into the browser, which would then talk to the OS.</p>\", \"id\": \"ec469ce0-0430-434f-9e94-d4364e2b1b43\"}, {\"type\": \"paragraph\", \"value\": \"<p>Most of the early WebAssembly code was compiled with Emscripten. So when people started wanting to run WebAssembly without a browser, they started by making Emscripten-compiled code run.</p><p>So these runtimes needed to create their own implementations for all of these functions that were in the JS glue code.</p><p>There\\u2019s a problem here, though. The interface provided by this JS glue code wasn\\u2019t designed to be a standard, or even a public facing interface. That wasn\\u2019t the problem it was solving.</p><p>For example, for a function that would be called something like <code>read</code> in an API that was designed to be a public interface, the JS glue code instead uses <code>_system3(which, varargs)</code>.</p>\", \"id\": \"e44949b1-1220-4b7e-8ae8-c174c87b6f93\"}, {\"type\": \"paragraph\", \"value\": \"<p>The first parameter, <code>which</code>, is an integer which is always the same as the number in the name (so 3 in this case).</p><p>The second parameter, <code>varargs</code>, are the arguments to use. It\\u2019s called <code>varargs</code> because you can have a variable number of them. But WebAssembly doesn\\u2019t provide a way to pass in a variable number of arguments to a function. So instead, the arguments are passed in via linear memory. This isn\\u2019t type safe, and it\\u2019s also slower than it would be if the arguments could be passed in using registers.</p><p>That was fine for Emscripten running in the browser. But now runtimes are treating this as a de facto standard, implementing their own versions of the JS glue code. They are emulating an internal detail of an emulation layer of POSIX.</p><p>This means they are re-implementing choices (like passing arguments in as heap values) that made sense based on Emscripten\\u2019s constraints, even though these constraints don\\u2019t apply in their environments.</p>\", \"id\": \"a9e69d57-d3cb-4d7c-90e7-1d053c5ac55c\"}, {\"type\": \"paragraph\", \"value\": \"<p>If we\\u2019re going to build a WebAssembly ecosystem that lasts for decades, we need solid foundations.

Let\\u2019s look at where they fall short.</p><h4>Portability</h4><p>POSIX provides source code portability.

A user has a certain set of files that they have access to.</p><p>When the user starts the program, the program runs on behalf of that user. If the user has access to the file\\u200a\\u2014\\u200aeither because they are the owner or because they are in a group with access\\u200a\\u2014\\u200athen the program has that same access, too.</p>\", \"id\": \"1fc49716-f400-4cab-9884-f9d75b643b55\"}, {\"type\": \"paragraph\", \"value\": \"<p>This protects users from each other.

Systems now are usually single user, but they are running code that pulls in lots of other, third party code of unknown trustworthiness. Now the biggest threat is that the code that you yourself are running will turn against you.</p><p>For example, let\\u2019s say that the library you\\u2019re using in an application gets a new maintainer (as often happens in open source). That maintainer might have your interest at heart\\u2026 or they might be one of the bad guys.

There\\u2019s a lot of overlap between data races and race conditions, but  they can also <a href=\\\"https://blog.regehr.org/archives/490\\\">occur independently</a>. <a href=\\\"https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2013/01/06/benign-data-races-what-could-possibly-go-wrong\\\">There are no benign data races</a>.</p><h3>Potential consequences of concurrency bugs:</h3><ol><li>Deadlock</li><li>Information loss: another thread overwrites information</li><li>Integrity loss: information from multiple threads is interlaced</li><li>Loss of liveness: performance problems resulting from uneven access to shared resources</li></ol><p>The best-known type of concurrency attack is called a <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_of_check_to_time_of_use\\\">TOCTOU</a>  (time of check to time of use) attack, which is a race condition  between checking a condition (like a security credential) and using the  results. TOCTOU attacks are examples of integrity loss.</p><p>Deadlocks and loss of <i>liveness</i> are considered performance  problems, not security issues, while information and integrity loss are  both more likely to be security-related.

Predicting how concurrent code  interacts with other concurrent code is difficult to do. When bugs  appear, they\\u2019re difficult to find and fix. Instead of relying on  programmers to worry about this, let\\u2019s look at ways to design programs  and use languages to make it easier to write concurrent code.</p><p>First, we need to define what \\u201cthreadsafe\\u201d means:</p><blockquote>  \\u201cA data type or static method is threadsafe if it behaves correctly  when used from multiple threads, regardless of how those threads are  executed, and without demanding additional coordination from the calling  code.\\u201d <a href=\\\"http://web.mit.edu/6.031/www/fa17/classes/20-thread-safety/\\\"><i>MIT</i></a> </blockquote><h2>How programming languages manage concurrency</h2><p>In languages that don\\u2019t statically enforce thread safety, programmers  must remain constantly vigilant when interacting with memory that can  be shared with another thread and could change at any time. In  sequential programming, we\\u2019re taught to avoid global variables in case  another part of code has silently modified them. Like manual memory  management, requiring programmers to safely mutate shared data is  problematic.</p>\", \"id\": \"91d74b07-d9e9-4ec5-81ff-587037093960\"}, {\"type\": \"paragraph\", \"value\": \"<p>Generally, programming languages are limited to two approaches for managing safe concurrency:</p><ol><li>Confining mutability or limiting sharing</li><li>Manual thread safety (e.g. locks, semaphores)</li></ol><p>Languages that limit threading either confine mutable variables to a  single thread or require that all shared variables be immutable. Both  approaches eliminate the core problem of data races\\u2014improperly mutating  shared data\\u2014but this can be too limiting. To solve this, languages have  introduced low-level synchronization primitives like <i>mutexes</i>. These can be used to build threadsafe data structures.</p><h3>Python and the global interpreter lock</h3><p>The reference implementation of Python, CPython, has a mutex called  the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which only allows a single thread to  access a Python object. Multi-threaded Python is notorious for being <a href=\\\"https://hackernoon.com/concurrent-programming-in-python-is-not-what-you-think-it-is-b6439c3f3e6a\\\">inefficient</a>  because of the time spent waiting to acquire the GIL. Instead, most  parallel Python programs use multiprocessing, meaning each process has  its own GIL.</p><h3>Java and runtime exceptions</h3><p><a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_concurrency\\\">Java</a>  is designed to support concurrent programming via a shared-memory  model. Each thread has its own execution path, but is able to access any  object in the program\\u2014it\\u2019s up to the programmer to synchronize accesses  between threads using Java built-in primitives.</p><p>While Java has the building blocks for creating thread-safe programs, <a href=\\\"https://www.journaldev.com/1061/thread-safety-in-java\\\">thread safety</a> is <b>not</b>  guaranteed by the compiler (unlike memory safety). If an unsynchronized  memory access occurs (aka a data race), then Java will raise a runtime  exception\\u2014however, this still relies on programmers appropriately using  concurrency primitives.</p><h3>C++ and the programmer\\u2019s brain</h3><p>While Python avoids data races by synchronizing everything with the  GIL, and Java raises runtime exceptions if it detects a data race, C++  relies on programmers to manually synchronize memory accesses. Prior to  C++11, the standard library <a href=\\\"http://www.modernescpp.com/index.php/c-core-guidelines-rules-for-concurrency-and-parallelism\\\">did not include concurrency primitives</a>.</p><p>Most programming languages provide programmers with the tools to  write thread-safe code, and post hoc methods exist for detecting data  races and race conditions; however, this does not result in any  guarantees of thread safety or data race freedom.</p><h2>How does Rust manage concurrency?</h2><p>Rust takes a multi-pronged approach to eliminating data races, using  ownership rules and type safety to guarantee data race freedom at  compile time.</p><p>The <a href=\\\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/01/fearless-security-memory-safety/\\\">first post</a>  of this series introduced ownership\\u2014one of the core concepts of Rust.  Each variable has a unique owner and can either be moved or borrowed. If  a different thread needs to modify a resource, then we can transfer  ownership by moving the variable to the new thread.</p><p>Moving enforces exclusion, allowing multiple threads to write to the  same memory, but never at the same time. Since an owner is confined to a  single thread, what happens if another thread borrows a variable?</p><p>In Rust, you can have either one mutable borrow or as many immutable  borrows as you want. You can never simultaneously have a mutable borrow  and an immutable borrow (or multiple mutable borrows). When we talk  about memory safety, this ensures that resources are freed properly, but  when we talk about thread safety, it means that only one thread can  ever modify a variable at a time. Furthermore, we know that no other  threads will try to reference an out of date borrow\\u2014borrowing enforces  either sharing or writing, but never both.</p><p>Ownership was designed to mitigate memory vulnerabilities. It turns out that it also prevents data races.</p><p>While many programming languages have methods to enforce memory  safety (like reference counting and garbage collection), they usually  rely on manual synchronization or prohibitions on concurrent sharing to  prevent data races. Rust\\u2019s approach addresses both kinds of safety by  attempting to solve the core problem of identifying valid resource use  and enforcing that validity during compilation.</p>\", \"id\": \"c12f78c0-153c-4b8a-89d3-6c76b85faca3\"}, {\"type\": \"paragraph\", \"value\": \"<h3>But wait! There\\u2019s more!</h3><p>The ownership rules prevent multiple threads from writing to the same  memory and disallow simultaneous sharing between threads and  mutability, but this doesn\\u2019t necessarily provide thread-safe data  structures. Every data structure in Rust is either thread-safe or it\\u2019s  not.

      "body": "[{\"type\": \"paragraph\", \"value\": \"<h2>Background: Add-Ons and Add-On Signing</h2><p>Although many people use Firefox out of the box, Firefox also supports a powerful extension mechanism called \\u201cadd-ons\\u201d. Add-ons allow users to add third party features to Firefox that extend the capabilities we offer by default. Currently there are over 15,000 Firefox add-ons with capabilities ranging from <a href=\\\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/\\\">blocking ads</a> to <a href=\\\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/\\\">managing hundreds of tabs</a>.</p><p>Firefox requires that all add-ons that are installed be <a href=\\\"https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2015/02/10/extension-signing-safer-experience/\\\">digitally signed</a>. This requirement is intended to protect users from malicious add-ons by requiring some minimal standard of review by Mozilla staff. Before we introduced this requirement in 2015, we had <a href=\\\"https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2015/04/15/the-case-for-extension-signing/\\\">serious problems</a> with malicious add-ons.</p><p>The way that the add-on signing works is that Firefox is configured with a preinstalled \\u201croot certificate\\u201d. That root is stored offline in a <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module\\\">hardware security module (HSM)</a>. Every few years it is used to sign a new \\u201cintermediate certificate\\u201d which is kept online and used as part of the signing process. When an add-on is presented for signature, we generate a new temporary \\u201cend-entity certificate\\u201d and sign that using the intermediate certificate. The end-entity certificate is then used to sign the add-on itself. Shown visually, this looks like this:</p>\", \"id\": \"21d4d37c-083b-4d8c-af93-f4c2d12502b4\"}, {\"type\": \"paragraph\", \"value\": \"<p>Note that each certificate has a \\u201csubject\\u201d (to whom the certificate  belongs) and an \\u201cissuer\\u201d (the signer). In the case of the root, these  are the same entity, but for other certificates, the issuer of a  certificate is the subject of the certificate that signed it.</p><p>An important point here is that each add-on is signed by its own  end-entity certificate, but nearly all add-ons share the same  intermediate certificate <a href=\\\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/05/technical-details-on-the-recent-firefox-add-on-outage/#footnote-1\\\">[1]</a>.  It is this certificate that encountered a problem: Each certificate has  a fixed period during which it is valid. Before or after this window,  the certificate won\\u2019t be accepted, and an add-on signed with that  certificate can\\u2019t be loaded into Firefox. Unfortunately, the  intermediate certificate we were using expired just after 1AM UTC on May  4, and immediately every add-on that was signed with that certificate  become unverifiable and could not be loaded into Firefox.</p><p>Although add-ons all expired around midnight, the impact of the  outage wasn\\u2019t felt immediately. The reason for this is that Firefox  doesn\\u2019t continuously check add-ons for validity. Rather, all add-ons are  checked about every 24 hours, with the time of the check being  different for each user. The result is that some people experienced  problems right away, some people didn\\u2019t experience them until much  later. We at Mozilla first became aware of the problem around 6PM  Pacific time on Friday May 3 and immediately assembled a team to try to  solve the issue.</p><h2>Damage Limitation</h2><p>Once we realized what we were up against, we took several steps to try to avoid things getting any worse.</p><p>First, we disabled signing of new add-ons. This was sensible at the  time because we were signing with a certificate that we knew was  expired. In retrospect, it might have been OK to leave it up, but it  also turned out to interfere with the \\u201chardwiring a date\\u201d mitigation we  discuss below (though eventually didn\\u2019t use) and so it\\u2019s good we  preserved the option. Signing is now back up.</p><p>Second, we immediately pushed a hotfix which suppressed re-validating  the signatures on add-ons. The idea here was to avoid breaking users  who hadn\\u2019t re-validated yet. We did this before we had any other fix,  and have removed it now that fixes are available.</p><h2>Working in Parallel</h2><p>In theory, fixing a problem like this looks simple: make a new, valid  certificate and republish every add-on with that certificate.  Unfortunately, we quickly determined that this wouldn\\u2019t work for a  number of reasons:</p><ol><li>There are a very large number of add-ons (over 15,000) and the  signing service isn\\u2019t optimized for bulk signing, so just re-signing  every add-on would take longer than we wanted.</li><li>Once add-ons were signed, users would need to get a new add-on. Some  add-ons are hosted on Mozilla\\u2019s servers and Firefox would update those  add-ons within 24 hours, but users would have to manually update any  add-ons that they had installed from other sources, which would be very  inconvenient.</li></ol><p>Instead, we focused on trying to develop a fix which we could provide to all our users with little or no manual intervention.</p><p>After examining a number of approaches, we quickly converged on two major strategies which we pursued in parallel:</p><ol><li>Patching Firefox to change the date which is used to validate the  certificate. This would make existing add-ons magically work again, but  required shipping a new build of Firefox (a \\u201cdot release\\u201d).</li><li>Generate a replacement certificate that was still valid and somehow  convince Firefox to accept it instead of the existing, expired  certificate.</li></ol><p>We weren\\u2019t sure that either of these would work, so we decided to  pursue them in parallel and deploy the first one that looked like it was  going to work. At the end of the day, we ended up deploying the second  fix, the new certificate, which I\\u2019ll describe in some more detail below.</p><h2>A Replacement Certificate</h2><p>As suggested above, there are two main steps we had to follow here:</p><ol><li>Generate a new, valid, certificate.</li><li>Install it remotely in Firefox.</li></ol><p>In order to understand why this works, you need to know a little more  about how Firefox validates add-ons. The add-on itself comes as a  bundle of files that includes the certificate chain used to sign it. The  result is that the add-on is independently verifiable as long as you  know the root certificate, which is configured into Firefox at build  time. However, as I said, the intermediate certificate was broken, so  the add-on wasn\\u2019t actually verifiable.</p><p>However, it turns out that when Firefox tries to validate the add-on,  it\\u2019s not limited to just using the certificates in the add-on itself.  Instead, it tries to build a valid chain of certificates starting at the  end-entity certificate and continuing until it gets to the root. The  algorithm is complicated, but at a high level, you start with the  end-entity certificate and then find a certificate whose subject is  equal to the issuer of the end-entity certificate (i.e., the  intermediate certificate). In the simple case, that\\u2019s just the  intermediate that shipped with the add-on, but it could be any  certificate that the browser happens to know about. If we can remotely  add a new, valid, certificate, then Firefox will try that as well. The  figure below shows the situation before and after we install the new  certificate.</p>\", \"id\": \"c78876c4-69c4-4123-b760-73803f269e2d\"}, {\"type\": \"paragraph\", \"value\": \"<p>Once the new certificate is installed, Firefox has two choices for  how to validate the certificate chain, use the old invalid certificate  (which won\\u2019t work) and use the new valid certificate (which will work).  An important feature here is that the new certificate has the same  subject name and public key as the old certificate, so that its  signature on the End-Entity certificate is valid. Fortunately, Firefox  is smart enough to try both until it finds a path that works, so the  add-on becomes valid again. Note that this is the same logic we use for  validating TLS certificates, so it\\u2019s relatively well understood code  that we were able to leverage.<a href=\\\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/05/technical-details-on-the-recent-firefox-add-on-outage/#footnote-2\\\">[2]</a></p><p>The great thing about this fix is that it doesn\\u2019t require us to  change any existing add-on. As long as we get the new certificate into  Firefox, then even add-ons which are carrying the old certificate will  just automatically verify. The tricky bit then becomes getting the new  certificate into Firefox, which we need to do automatically and  remotely, and then getting Firefox to recheck all the add-ons that may  have been disabled.</p><h2>Normandy and the Studies System</h2><p>Ironically, the solution to this problem is a special type of add-on  called a system add-on (SAO). In order to let us do research studies, we  have developed a system called Normandy which lets us serve SAOs to  Firefox users. Those SAOs automatically execute on the user\\u2019s browser  and while they are usually used for running experiments, they also have  extensive access to Firefox internal APIs. Important for this case, they  can add new certificates to the certificate database that Firefox uses  to verify add-ons.<a href=\\\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/05/technical-details-on-the-recent-firefox-add-on-outage/#footnote-3\\\">[3]</a></p><p>So the fix here is to build a SAO which does two things:</p><ol><li>Install the new certificate we have made.</li><li>Force the browser to re-verify every add-on so that the ones which were disabled become active.</li></ol><p>But wait, you say. Add-ons don\\u2019t work so how do we get it to run? Well, we sign it with the new certificate!</p><h2>Putting it all together\\u2026 and what took so long?</h2><p>OK, so now we\\u2019ve got a plan: issue a new certificate to replace the  old one, build a system add-on to install it on Firefox, and deploy it  via Normandy. Starting from about 6 PM Pacific on Friday May 3, we were  shipping the fix in Normandy at 2:44 AM, or after less than 9 hours, and  then it took another 6-12 hours before most of our users had it. This  is actually quite good from a standing start, but I\\u2019ve seen a number of  questions on Twitter about why we couldn\\u2019t get it done faster. There are  a number of steps that were time consuming.</p><p>First, it took a while to issue the new intermediate certificate. As I  mentioned above, the Root certificate is in a hardware security module  which is stored offline. This is good security practice, as you use the  Root very rarely and so you want it to be secure, but it\\u2019s obviously  somewhat inconvenient if you want to issue a new certificate on an  emergency basis. At any rate, one of our engineers had to drive to the  secure location where the HSM is stored. Then there were a few false  starts where we didn\\u2019t issue exactly the right certificate, and each  attempt cost an hour or two of testing before we knew exactly what to  do.</p><p>Second, developing the system add-on takes some time. It\\u2019s  conceptually very simple, but even simple programs require taking some  care, and we really wanted to make sure we didn\\u2019t make things worse. And  before we shipped the SAO, we had to test it, and that takes time,  especially because it has to be signed. But the signing system was  disabled, so we had to find some workarounds for that.</p><p>Finally, once we had the SAO ready to ship, it still takes time to  deploy. Firefox clients check for Normandy updates every 6 hours, and of  course many clients are offline, so it takes some time for the fix to  propagate through the Firefox population. However, at this point we  expect that most people have received the update and/or the dot release  we did later.</p><h2>Final Steps</h2><p>While the SAO that was deployed with Studies should fix most users,  it didn\\u2019t get to everyone. In particular, there are a number of types of  affected users who will need another approach:</p><ul><li>Users who have disabled either Telemetry or Studies.</li><li>Users on Firefox for Android (Fennec), where we don\\u2019t have Studies.</li><li> Users of downstream builds of Firefox ESR that don\\u2019t opt-in to<br/> telemetry reporting.</li><li>Users who are behind HTTPS Man-in-the-middle proxies, because our  add-on installation systems enforce key pinning for these connections,  which proxies interfere with.</li><li>Users of very old builds of Firefox which the Studies system can\\u2019t reach.</li></ul><p>We can\\u2019t really do anything about the last group \\u2014 they should update  to a new version of Firefox anyway because older versions typically  have quite serious unfixed security vulnerabilities. We know that some  people have stayed on older versions of Firefox because they want to run  old-style add-ons, but many of these now work with newer versions of  Firefox. For the other groups we have developed a patch to Firefox that  will install the new certificate once people update. This was released  as a \\u201cdot release\\u201d so people will get it \\u2014 and probably have already \\u2014  through the ordinary update channel. If you have a downstream build,  you\\u2019ll need to wait for your build maintainer to update.</p><p>We recognize that none of this is perfect. In particular, in some  cases, users lost data associated with their add-ons (an example here is  the <a href=\\\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1549204\\\">\\u201cmulti-account containers\\u201d add-on</a>).</p><p>We were unable to develop a fix that would avoid this side effect,  but we believe this is the best approach for the most users in the short  term. Long term, we will be looking at better architectural approaches  for dealing with this kind of issue.</p><h2>Lessons</h2><p>First, I want to say that the team here did amazing work: they built  and shipped a fix in less than 12 hours from the initial report. As  someone who sat in the meeting where it happened, I can say that people  were working incredibly hard in a tough situation and that very little  time was wasted.</p><p>With that said, obviously this isn\\u2019t an ideal situation and it  shouldn\\u2019t have happened in the first place. We clearly need to adjust  our processes both to make this and similar incidents it less likely to  happen and to make them easier to fix.</p><p>We\\u2019ll be running a formal post-mortem next week and will publish the  list of changes we intend to make, but in the meantime here are my  initial thoughts about what we need to do. First, we should have a much  better way of tracking the status of everything in Firefox that is a  potential time bomb and making sure that we don\\u2019t find ourselves in a  situation where one goes off unexpectedly. We\\u2019re still working out the  details here, but at minimum we need to inventory everything of this  nature.</p><p>Second, we need a mechanism to be able to quickly push updates to our users even when \\u2014 <i>especially when</i>  \\u2014 everything else is down. \\u00a0It was great that we are able to use the  Studies system, but it was also an imperfect tool that we pressed into  service, and that had some undesirable side effects. In particular, we  know that many users have auto-updates enabled but would prefer not to  participate in Studies and that\\u2019s a reasonable preference (true story: I  had it off as well!) but at the same time we need to be able to push  updates to our users; whatever the internal technical mechanisms, users  should be able to opt-in to updates (including hot-fixes) but opt out of  everything else. Additionally, the update channel should be more  responsive than what we have today. Even on Monday, we still had some  users who hadn\\u2019t picked up either the hotfix or the dot release, which  clearly isn\\u2019t ideal. There\\u2019s been some work on this problem already, but  this incident shows just how important it is.</p><p>Finally, we\\u2019ll be looking more generally at our add-on security  architecture to make sure that it\\u2019s enforcing the right security  properties at the least risk of breakage.</p><p>We\\u2019ll be following up next week with the results of a more thorough  post-mortem, but in the meantime, I\\u2019ll be happy to answer questions by  email at ekr-blog@mozilla.com.</p><p>[1] A few very old add-ons were signed with a different intermediate.</p><p>[2] Readers who are familiar with the WebPKI will recognize that this is also the way that cross-certification works.<br/> [3] Technical note: we  aren\\u2019t adding the certificate with any special privileges; it gets its  authority by being signed for the root. We\\u2019re just adding it to the pool  of certificates which can be used by Firefox. So, it\\u2019s not like we are  adding a new privileged certificate to Firefox.</p>\", \"id\": \"5d512021-c988-420c-8a27-14b5d3fc2545\"}]",

As you scroll around, the browser increases or decreases your distance from the top.</p><p>But what happens if an ad loads on a page above where you are reading?</p><p>The browser keeps you at the same distance from the top of the page, but now there is more content between what you\\u2019re reading and the top. In effect, this moves the visible part of the page up away from what you\\u2019re reading (and oftentimes into the ad that\\u2019s just loaded).</p><p>Or, what if you rotate your phone to portrait mode?</p><p>Now there\\u2019s much less horizontal space on the screen, and a paragraph that was <code>100px</code> tall may now be <code>200px</code> tall. If the paragraph you were reading was <code>1000px</code> from the top of the page before rotating, it may now be <code>2000px</code> from the top of the page after rotating. If the browser is still scrolled to <code>1000px</code>, you\\u2019ll be looking at content far above where you were before.</p><p>The key insight to fixing these issues is that users don\\u2019t care what distance they are from the top of the page. They care about their position relative to the content they\\u2019re looking at!</p><p><a href=\\\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow-anchor/Guide_to_scroll_anchoring\\\">Scroll anchoring</a> works to <i>anchor</i> the user to the content that they\\u2019re looking at. As this content is moved by ads, screen rotations, screen resizes, or other causes, the page now scrolls to keep you at the same relative position to it.</p><h2>Demos</h2><p>Let\\u2019s take a look at some examples of scroll anchoring in action.</p><p>Here\\u2019s a <a href=\\\"https://eqrion.github.io/web-tests/scrolling/anchor-slider.html\\\">page</a> with a slider that changes the height of an element at the top of the page. Scroll anchoring prevents the element above the viewport from changing what you\\u2019re looking at.</p>\", \"id\": \"45a84ab4-2a05-4fe2-92cb-d65c5590f65c\"}, {\"type\": \"paragraph\", \"value\": \"<p>Here\\u2019s a <a href=\\\"https://eqrion.github.io/web-tests/scrolling/anchor-animation.html\\\">page</a> using CSS animations and transforms to change the height of elements on the page.

The algorithm attempts to pick content that is small and near the top of the page. The exact steps are slightly complicated, but roughly it works by iterating over the elements in the DOM and choosing the first one that is visible on the screen.</p><p>When a new element is added to the page, or the screen is rotated/resized, the page\\u2019s layout needs to be recalculated. During this process, we check to see if the anchor node has been moved to a new location. If so, we scroll to keep the page in the same relative position to the anchor node.</p><p>The end result is that changes to the layout of a page above the anchor node are not able to change the relative position of the anchor node on the screen.</p><h2>Web compatibility</h2><p>New features are great, but do they break websites for users?</p><p>This feature is an <a href=\\\"https://github.com/WICG/interventions\\\">intervention</a>. It breaks established behavior of the web to fix an annoyance for users.</p><p>It\\u2019s similar to how browsers worked to prevent popup-ads in the past, and the ongoing work to prevent autoplaying audio and video.</p><p>This type of workaround comes with some risk, as existing websites have expectations about how scrolling works.</p><p>Scroll anchoring mitigates the risk with several <a href=\\\"https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scroll-anchoring/#suppression-triggers\\\">heuristics</a> to disable the feature in situations that have caused problems with existing websites.</p><p>Additionally, a new CSS property has been introduced, <a href=\\\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow-anchor\\\"><code>overflow-anchor</code></a>, to allow websites to opt-out of scroll anchoring.</p><p>To use it, just add <code>overflow-anchor: none</code> on any scrolling element where you don\\u2019t want to use scroll anchoring. Additionally, you can add <code>overflow-anchor: none</code> to specific elements that you want to exclude from being selected as anchor nodes.</p><p>Of course there are still possible incompatibilities with existing sites. If you see a new issue caused by scroll anchoring, please <a href=\\\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Core&amp;component=Layout%3A+Scrolling+and+Overflow\\\">file a bug</a>!</p><h2>Future work</h2><p>The version of scroll anchoring shipping now in Firefox 66 is our initial implementation. In the months ahead we will continue to improve it.</p><p>The most significant effort will involve improving the algorithm used to select an anchor.</p><p>Scroll anchoring is most effective when it selects an anchor that\\u2019s small and near the top of your screen.</p><ol><li>If the anchor is too large, it\\u2019s possible that content inside of it will expand or shrink in a way that we won\\u2019t adjust for.</li><li>If the anchor is too far from the top of the screen, it\\u2019s possible that content below what you\\u2019re looking at will expand and cause unwanted scroll adjustments.</li></ol><p>We\\u2019ve found that our implementation of the specification can select inadequate anchors on pages with table layouts or significant content inside of <code>overflow: hidden</code>.</p><p>This is due to a fuzzy area of the specification where we chose an approach different than Chrome\\u2019s implementation. This is one of the values of multiple browser implementations: We have gained significant experience with scroll anchoring and hope to bring that to the specification, to ensure it isn\\u2019t defined by the implementation details of only one browser.</p><p>The scroll anchoring feature in Firefox has been developed by many people. Thanks go out to Daniel Holbert, David Baron, Emilio Cobos \\u00c1lvarez, and Hiroyuki Ikezoe for their guidance and many reviews.</p>\", \"id\": \"7824593a-1e0b-44b4-9e29-7c1ac43ba716\"}]",

The currently focused element can be found with <code>document.activeElement</code>.</p><p>By default, browsers convey which element currently has focus by drawing an outline around that element. The defaults vary between browsers and platform. With CSS, you can override these defaults, which we\\u2019ll get to in a bit.</p><h3>Who benefits</h3><p>Focus outlines help users figure out where they are on a page. They show which form field is currently filled in, or which button is about to be pressed. People who use a mouse, might use their cursor for this, but not everyone uses a mouse. For instance, there are many keyboard users: a person with a baby on one arm, people with chronic diseases that prevent the use of a mouse, and of course\\u2026 developers and other power users. Beyond keyboards, there are other tools and input devices that rely on clearly indicated focus, like <a href=\\\"https://axesslab.com/switches/\\\">switches</a>.</p><p>It is not just keyboard users that benefit, though. Focus indication also helps people who have limited attention spans or issues with short term memory, for example if they are filling out a lengthy form.</p><p>If the idea of indicating the current element in a website seems weird, consider TV interfaces. Most people use them with a remote control or game controller, and therefore rely on the interface to convey what\\u2019s currently selected.</p><h3>Never remove them</h3><p>Not everyone likes how focus outlines look, some find them ugly. But then that\\u2019s the case with street lights, too. They are unlikely to win design awards, but if you have to walk home in the dark, you are glad they help you see where you are.</p><p>Removing focus styles, as some websites do, is as detrimental for keyboard users as removing the mouse cursor would be for mouse users.</p><p>Nobody would override the browser\\u2019s default cursor, effectively removing the cursor altogether:</p>\", \"id\": \"c07be35a-961c-4e52-8436-3177eeda87c7\"}]",

This, in turn, has evolved an insatiable appetite for data among advertisers aggressively iterating on models to drive human clicks.</p><blockquote><i>Most of the content, products, and services we use online, whether provided by media organisations or by technology companies, are funded in whole or in part by advertising and various forms of marketing.</i><br/> \\u2013Timothy Libert and Rasmus Kleis Nielsen [<a href=\\\"https://timlibert.me/pdf/Libert_Nielsen-2018-Third_Party_Content_EU_News_GDPR.pdf\\\">link</a>]</blockquote><p>We\\u2019ve talked about the potentially adverse effects on the <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/firefox-context-graph/are-trackers-the-new-backbone-of-the-web-fb800435da15\\\">Web\\u2019s morphology</a> and how content silos can <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/firefox-context-graph/context-graph-its-time-to-bring-context-back-to-the-web-a7542fe45cf3\\\">impede a diversity of viewpoints</a>. Now, the Mozilla Systems Research Group is raising a call to action. <a href=\\\"https://github.com/mozilla/overscripted\\\">Help us</a> search for patterns that describe, expose, and illuminate the complex interactions between people and pages!</p><p>Inspired by the <a href=\\\"https://webtransparency.cs.princeton.edu/webcensus/\\\">Web Census</a> recently published by <a href=\\\"https://senglehardt.com/\\\">Steven Englehardt</a> and <a href=\\\"http://randomwalker.info/\\\">Arvind Narayanan</a> of Princeton University, we adapted the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/citp/OpenWPM\\\">OpenWPM</a> crawler framework to perform a comparable crawl gathering a rich set of information about the JavaScript execution on various websites. This enables us to delve into further analysis of web tracking, as well as a general exploration of client-page interactions and a survey of different APIs employed on the modern Web.</p><p>In short, we set out to explore the unseen or otherwise not obvious series of JavaScript execution events that are triggered once a user visits a webpage, and all the first- and third-party events that are set in motion when people retrieve content. To help enable more exploration and analysis, we are providing our <a href=\\\"https://github.com/mozilla/overscripted\\\">full set of data about JavaScript executions</a> open source.</p><p>The following sections will introduce the data set, how it was collected and the decisions made along the way. We\\u2019ll share examples of insights we\\u2019ve discovered and we\\u2019ll provide information on how to participate in the associated <a href=\\\"https://challenges.mozilla.community/overscripted/\\\">\\u201cOverscripted Web: A Mozilla Data Analysis Challenge\\u201d</a>, which we\\u2019ve <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/mozilla-open-innovation/overscripted-91881d8662c3\\\">launched today</a> with Mozilla\\u2019s Open Innovation Team.</p><h2>The Dataset</h2><p>In October 2017, several Mozilla staff and a group of Canadian undergraduate students <a href=\\\"https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/\\\">forked</a> the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/citp/OpenWPM\\\">OpenWPM</a> crawler repository to begin tinkering, in order to collect a plethora of information about the unseen interactions between modern websites and the Firefox web browser.</p><h3>Preparing the seed list</h3><p>The <a href=\\\"https://github.com/RuizhiYou/URLCrawler/blob/master/intersect_url.csv\\\">master list of pages</a> we crawled in preparing the dataset was itself generated from a preliminary shallow crawl we performed in November 2017. We ran a <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler#Selection_policy\\\">depth-1 crawl</a>, seeded by <a href=\\\"https://www.alexa.com/topsites\\\">Alexa\\u2019s top 10,000 site list</a>, using 4 different machines at 4 different IP addresses (all in residential non-Amazon IP addresses served by Canadian internet service providers). The crawl was implemented using the <a href=\\\"http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/\\\">Requests</a> Python library and collected no information except for an indication of successful page loads.</p><p>Of the 2,150,251 pages represented in the union of the 4 parallel shallow crawls, we opted to use the intersection of the four lists in order to prune out dynamically generated (e.g. personalized) outbound links that varied between them. This meant a reduction to 981,545 URLs, which formed the seed list for our main OpenWPM crawl.</p><h3>The Main Collection</h3><p>The following workflow describes (at a high level) the collection of page information contained in this dataset.</p><ol><li>Alexa top 10k (10,000 high traffic pages as of November 1st, 2017)</li><li>Precrawl using the python <i>Requests</i> library, visits each one of those pages<br/><ol><li>Request library requests that page</li><li>That page sends a response</li><li>All href tags in the response are captured to a depth of 1 (away from Alexa page)<br/><ol><li>For each of those href tags all valid pages (starts with \\u201chttp\\u201d) are added to the link set.</li><li>The link set union (2,150,251) was examined using the request library in parallel, which gives us the intersection list of 981,545.</li><li>The set of urls in the list 981,545 is passed to the deeper crawl for JavaScript analysis in a parallelized form.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Each of these pages was sent to our adapted version of OpenWPM to have the execution of JavaScript recorded for 10 seconds.</li><li>The <code>window.location</code> was hashed as the unique identifier of the location where the JavaScript was executed (to ensure unique source attribution).<br/><ol><li>When OpenWPM hits content that is inside an iFrame, the location of the content is reported.</li><li>Since we use the <code>window.location</code> to determine the location element of the content, each time an iFrame is encountered, that location can be split into the parent location of the page and the iFrame location.</li><li>Data collection and aggregation performed through a websocket associates all the activity linked to a location hash for compilation of the crawl dataset.</li></ol></li></ol><p>Interestingly, for the Alexa top 10,000 sites, our depth-1 crawl yielded properties hosted on 41,166 TLDs across the union of our 4 replicates, whereas only 34,809 unique TLDs remain among the 981,545 pages belonging to their intersection.</p><p>A <a href=\\\"https://github.com/RuizhiYou/OpenWPM/tree/RunThis\\\">modified version of OpenWPM</a> was used to record JavaScript calls potentially used for browsers tracking data from these pages. The collected JavaScript execution trace was written into an s3 bucket for later aggregation and analysis. Several additional parameters were defined based on cursory ad hoc analyses.</p><p>For example, the minimum dwell time per page required to capture the majority of JavaScript activity was set as 10 seconds per page. This was based on a random sampling of the seed list URLs and showed a large variation in time until no new JavaScript was being executed (from no JavaScript, to what appeared to be an infinite loop of self-referential JavaScript calls). This dwell time was chosen to balance between capturing the majority of JavaScript activity on a majority of the pages and minimizing the time required to complete the full crawl.</p><p>Several of the probes instrumented in the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/groovecoder/data-leak\\\">Data Leak</a> repo were ported over to our hybrid crawler, including instrumentation to monitor JavaScript execution occuring inside an iFrame element (potentially hosted on a third-party domain). This would prove to provide much insight into the relationships between pages in the crawl data.</p><h2>Exploratory work</h2><p>In January 2018, we got to work analyzing the dataset we had created. After substantial data cleaning to work through the messiness of real world variation, we were left with a gigantic \\u00a0<a href=\\\"https://parquet.apache.org/\\\">Parquet</a> dataset (around 70GB) containing an immense diversity of potential insights. Three example analyses are summarized below. The most important finding is that we have only just scratched the surface of the insights this data may hold.</p><h3>Examining session replay activity</h3><p><a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_replay\\\">Session replay</a> is a service that lets websites track users\\u2019 interactions with the page\\u2014from how they navigate the site, to their searches, to the input they provide. Think of it as a \\u201cvideo replay\\u201d of a user\\u2019s entire session on a webpage. Since some session replay providers may record personal information such as personal addresses, credit card information and passwords, this can present a significant risk to both privacy and security.</p><p>We explored the incidence of session replay usage, and a few associated features, across the pages in our crawl dataset. To identify potential session replay, we obtained the <a href=\\\"https://webtransparency.cs.princeton.edu/no_boundaries/session_replay_sites.html\\\">Princeton WebTAP project</a> list, containing 14 Alexa top-10,000 session replay providers, and checked for requests to script URLs belonging to the list.</p><p>Out of 6,064,923 distinct script references among page loads in our dataset, we found 95,570 (1.6%) were to session replay providers. This translated to 4,857 distinct domain names (netloc) making such requests, out of a total of 87,325, or 5.6%. Note that even if scripts belonging to session replay providers are being accessed, this does not necessarily mean that session replay functionality is being used on the site.</p><p>Given the set of pages making requests to session replay providers, we also looked into the consistency of SSL usage across these requests. Interestingly, the majority of such requests were made over HTTPS (75.7%), and 49.9% of the pages making these requests were accessed over HTTPS. Additionally, we found no pages accessed over HTTPS making requests to session replay scripts over HTTP, which was surprising but encouraging.</p><p>Finally, we examined the distribution of TLDs across sites making requests to session replay providers, and compared this to TLDs over the full dataset. We found that, along with .com, .ru accounted for a surprising proportion of sites accessing such scripts (around 33%), whereas .ru domain names made up only 3% of all pages crawled. This implies that 65.6% of .ru sites in our dataset were making requests to potential session replay provider scripts. However, this may be explained by the fact that Yandex is one of the primary session replay providers, and it offers a range of other analytics services of interest to Russian-language websites.</p><h3>Eval and dynamically created function calls</h3><p>JavaScript allows a function call to be dynamically created from a string with the <code>eval()</code> function or by creating a new <code>Function()</code> object. For example, this code will print hello twice:</p>\", \"id\": \"ae479318-461a-417f-a803-cf5bca6a62c7\"}, {\"type\": \"code_snippet\", \"value\": {\"language\": \"js\", \"code\": \"eval(\\\"console.log('hello')\\\")\\r\\nvar my_func = new Function(\\\"console.log('hello')\\\")\\r\\nmy_func()\"}, \"id\": \"5f3c59bf-4bd7-4a98-a549-eba73a4110f7\"}, {\"type\": \"paragraph\", \"value\": \"<p>While dynamic function creation has its uses, it also opens up users to injection attacks, such as <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting\\\">cross-site scripting</a>, and can potentially be used to hide malicious code.</p><p>In order to understand how dynamic function creation is being used on the Web, we analyzed its prevalence, location, and distribution in our dataset. The analysis was initially performed on 10,000 randomly selected pages and validated against the entire dataset. In terms of prevalence, we found that 3.72% of overall function calls were created dynamically, and these originated from across 8.76% of the websites crawled in our dataset.</p><p>These results suggest that, while dynamic function creation is not used heavily, it is still common enough on the Web to be a potential concern. Looking at call frequency per page showed that, while some Web pages create all their function calls dynamically, the majority tend to have only 1 or 2 dynamically generated calls (which is generally 1-5% of all calls made by a page).</p><p>We also examined the extent of this practice among the scripts that are being called. We discovered that they belong to a relatively small subset of script hosts (at an average ratio of about 33 calls per URL), indicating that the same JavaScript files are being used by multiple webpages. Furthermore, around 40% of these are known trackers (identified using the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/disconnectme/disconnect-tracking-protection\\\">disconnectme entity list</a>), although only 33% are hosted on a different domain from the webpage that uses them. This suggests that web developers may not even know that they are using dynamically generated functions.</p><h3>Cryptojacking</h3><p>Cryptojacking refers to the unauthorized use of a user\\u2019s computer or mobile device to mine cryptocurrency. More and more websites are using browser-based cryptojacking scripts as cryptocurrencies rise in popularity. It is an easy way to generate revenue and a viable alternative to bloating a website with ads. An excellent contextualization of crypto-mining via client-side JavaScript execution can be found in the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/mozilla/UCOSP-winter-2018_TrackingTechnologies/blob/master/analyses/cryptojacking/cryptojacking_analysis.md\\\">unabridged cryptojacking analysis</a> prepared by Vivian Jin.</p><p>We investigated the prevalence of cryptojacking among the websites represented in our dataset. A list of potential cryptojacking hosts (212 sites total) was obtained from the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/hoshsadiq/adblock-nocoin-list/blob/master/hosts.txt\\\">adblock-nocoin-list GitHub repo</a>. For each script call initiated on a page visit event, we checked whether the script host belonged to the list. Among 6,069,243 distinct script references on page loads in our dataset, only 945 (0.015%) were identified as cryptojacking hosts. Over half of these belonged to CoinHive, the original script developer. Only one use of AuthedMine was found. Viewed in terms of domains reached in the crawl, we found calls to cryptojacking scripts being made from 49 out of 29,483 distinct domains (0.16%).</p><p>However, it is important to note that cryptojacking code can be executed in other ways than by including the host script in a script tag. It can be disguised, stealthily executed in an iframe, or directly used in a function of a first-party script. Users may also face redirect loops that eventually lead to a page with a mining script. The low detection rate could also be due to the popularity of the sites covered by the crawl, which might \\u00a0dissuade site owners from implementing obvious cryptojacking scripts. It is likely that the actual rate of cryptojacking is higher.</p><p>The majority of the domains we found using cryptojacking are streaming sites. This is unsurprising, as users have streaming sites open for longer while they watch video content, and mining scripts can be executed longer. A Chinese variety site called 52pk.com accounted for 207 out of the overall 945 cryptojacking script calls we found in our analysis, by far the largest domain we observed for cryptojacking calls.</p><p>Another interesting fact: although our cryptojacking host list contained 212 candidates, we found only 11 of them to be active in our dataset, or about 5%.</p><h3>Limitations and future directions</h3><p>While this is a rich dataset allowing for a number of interesting analyses, it is limited in visibility mainly to behaviours that occur via JS API calls.</p><p>Another feature we investigated using our dataset is the presence of <a href=\\\"https://samy.pl/evercookie/\\\"><i>Evercookies</i></a>. <i>Evercookies</i> is a tracking tool used by websites to ensure that user data, such as a user ID, remains permanently stored on a computer. Evercookies persist in the browser by leveraging a series of tricks including Web API calls to a variety of available storage mechanisms. An initial attempt was made to search for evercookies in this data by searching for consistent values being passed to suspect Web API calls.</p><p>Acar et al., \\u201cThe Web Never Forgets: Persistent Tracking Mechanisms in the Wild\\u201d, (2014) <a href=\\\"https://securehomes.esat.kuleuven.be/~gacar/persistent/the_web_never_forgets.pdf\\\">developed techniques</a> for looking at evercookies at scale. First, they proposed a mechanism to detect identifiers. They applied this mechanism to HTTP cookies but noted that it could also be applied to other storage mechanisms, although some modification would be required. For example, they look at cookie expiration, which would not be applicable in the case of localStorage. For this dataset we could try replicating their methodology for set calls to <code>window.document.cookie</code> and <code>window.localStorage</code>.</p><p>They also looked at Flash cookies respawning HTTP cookies and HTTP respawning Flash cookies. Our dataset contains no information on the presence of Flash cookies, so additional crawls would be required to obtain this information. In addition, they used multiple crawls to study Flash respawning, so we would have to replicate that procedure.</p><p>In addition to our lack of information on Flash cookies, we have no information about HTTP cookies, the first mechanism by which cookies are set. Knowing which HTTP cookies are initially set can serve as an important complement and validation for investigating other storage techniques then used for respawning and evercookies.</p><p>Beyond HTTP and Flash, Samy Kamkar\\u2019s <a href=\\\"https://samy.pl/evercookie/\\\">evercookie library</a> documents over a dozen mechanisms for storing an id to be used as an evercookie. Many of these are not detectable by our current dataset, e.g. HTTP Cookies, HSTS Pinning, Flask Cookies, Silverlight Storage, ETags, Web cache, Internet Explorer userData storage, etc. An evaluation of the prevalence of each technique would be a useful contribution to the literature. We also see the value of an ongoing repeated crawl to identify changes in prevalence and accounting for new techniques as they are discovered.</p><p>However, it is possible to continue analyzing the current dataset for some of the techniques described by Samy. For example, <code>window.name caching</code> is listed as a technique. We can look at this property in our dataset, perhaps by applying the same ID technique outlined by Acar et al., or perhaps by looking at sequences of calls.</p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>Throughout our preliminary exploration of this data it became quickly apparent that the amount of superficial JavaScript execution on a Web page only tells part of the story. We have observed several examples of scripts running parallel to the content-serving functionality of webpages, these appear to fulfill a diversity of other functions. The analyses performed so far have led to some exciting discoveries, but so much more information remains hidden in the immense dataset available.</p><p>We are calling on any interested individuals to be part of the exploration.

Once you\\u2019re happy, open the <b>Changes</b> tab and see everything you did.</p><h3>What\\u2019s next for layout tools?</h3><p>We\\u2019re really excited for you to try these two new features and let us know <a href=\\\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/01/new-in-firefox-devtools-65/#contribute\\\">what you think</a>. But there\\u2019s more in store.</p><p>You\\u2019ve been <a href=\\\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/11/new-experimental-web-design-tools-feedback-requested/\\\">telling us exactly</a> what your biggest CSS challenges are, and we\\u2019ve been listening. We\\u2019re currently prototyping layout tools for debugging unwanted scrollbars, z-indexes that don\\u2019t work, and more tools like the Flexbox Inspector but for other types of layouts. Also, we\\u2019re going to make it even easier for you to extract your changes from the Changes panel.</p><h2>Smarter JavaScript inspection &amp; debugging</h2><p>When developing JavaScript, the Console and Debugger are your windows into your code\\u2019s execution flow and state changes. Over the past releases we\\u2019ve focused on making debugging work better for modern toolchains. Firefox 65 continues this theme.</p><h3>Collapsing Framework Stack Traces</h3><p>If you\\u2019re working with frameworks and build tools, then you\\u2019re used to seeing really long error stack traces in the Console. The new smarter stack traces identify 3rd party code (such as frameworks) and collapse it by default. This significantly reduces the information displayed in the <b>Console</b> and lets you focus on <i>your</i> code.</p>\", \"id\": \"42529f5e-90c7-4a91-a5fc-9483153ab98d\"}, {\"type\": \"paragraph\", \"value\": \"<p>The <b>Collapsing</b> feature works in the Console stack traces for errors and logs, and in the Debugger call stacks.</p><h3>Reverse search your Console history</h3><p>If you are tired of smashing the arrow key to find that awesome one-liner you ran one hour ago in the console, then this is for you. Reverse search is a well known command-line feature that lets you quickly browse recent commands that match the entered string.</p>\", \"id\": \"43e09ee4-64f4-4018-8264-83a2e531a914\"}, {\"type\": \"paragraph\", \"value\": \"<p>To use it in the Console, press <i>F9</i> on Windows/Linux or <i>Ctrl+R</i> on MacOS and start typing. You can then use <i>Ctrl+R</i> to move to the previous or <i>Ctrl+S</i> to the next result. Finally, hit return to confirm.</p><h3>Invoke getters to inspect the return value</h3><p>JavaScript <a href=\\\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get\\\">getters</a> are very useful for dynamic properties and heavily used in frameworks like <a href=\\\"https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/computed.html\\\">vue.js</a> for computed properties. But when you log an object with a getter to the Console, the reference to the method is logged, not its return value. The method does not get invoked automatically, as that could change your application\\u2019s state. Since you often actually want to see the value, you can now manually invoke getters on logged objects.</p>\", \"id\": \"c0894668-4f9f-4bc3-928a-c9d9d45db2f5\"}, {\"type\": \"paragraph\", \"value\": \"<p>Wherever objects can be inspected, in the Console or Debugger, you\\u2019ll see <code>&gt;&gt;</code> icons next to getters. Clicking these will execute the method and print the return value.</p><h3>Pause on XHR/Fetch Breakpoints</h3><p>Console logging is just one aspect of understanding application state. For complex issues, you need to pause state at precisely the right moment. Fetching data is usually one of those moments, and it is now made \\u201cpausable\\u201d with the new XHR/Fetch Breakpoint in the Debugger.</p>\", \"id\": \"0dde7228-9ca9-4f32-8875-4c4cb0e4388b\"}, {\"type\": \"paragraph\", \"value\": \"<p>Kudos to Firefox DevTools code contributor <a href=\\\"https://github.com/AnshulMalik\\\">Anshul Malik</a> for <a href=\\\"https://github.com/firefox-devtools/debugger.html/pull/6934#issuecomment-419260053\\\">\\u201ccasually\\u201d submitting</a> the patch for this useful feature and for his ongoing contributions.</p><h3>What\\u2019s next for JavaScript debugging?</h3><p>You might have noticed that we\\u2019ve been heads down over recent releases to make the JavaScript debugging experience rock solid \\u2013 for breakpoints, stepping, source maps, performance, etc. Raising the quality bar and continuing to polish and refine remains the focus for the entire team.</p><p>There\\u2019s work in progress on much requested features like <b>Column Breakpoints</b>, <b>Logpoints</b>, <b>Event</b> and <b>DOM Breakpoints</b>. Building out the authoring experience in the Console, we are adding an multi-line editing mode (inspired by <a href=\\\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/10/saying-goodbye-to-firebug/\\\">Firebug</a>) and a more powerful autocomplete.
