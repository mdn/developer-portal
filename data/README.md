# What's in /data/ ?

- `devportal-topic-icons` is a directory of SVG icons that are intended for upload via the Meta -> Theme -> Icon field on pages that appear as child pages in the navigation (all Topic pages, plus the People page and some Content Pages). They've been added to the repo for convenience and require manual addition because they are technically data, not design.
